Stocks forfeited gains following these headlines and steady selling in the major indexes pushed stocks to session lows in early afternoon trade before an afternoon rebound.\"These expectations have been seesawing for four consecutive months, alternating between increases and decreases,\" said Joanne Hsu, director for the survey of consumers. \"Uncertainty over short-run inflation expectations continues to be notably elevated, indicating that the recent volatility in expected year-ahead inflation is likely to continue.\"Overall, the report showed sentiment was \"essentially unchanged\" in April, as the index stood at 63.5, up from 62 at the end of March. This data came about an hour after Fed Governor Chris Waller reiterated in a speech that inflation remains \"much too high.\"Elsewhere on the economic calendar the monthly report on retail sales showed sales fell 1% in March while industrial production data came in better than expected.\"Overall, [retail sales were] not quite as bad as we had expected,\" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. \"Thanks to the strong January, first-quarter real consumption growth should be close to 4.5%, with GDP growth at 1.8%, which might be enough to persuade the Fed to hike by a final 25bp in early May.\"JPMorgan, the country\\'s largest bank by assets, saw shares rise more than 7% after reporting top- and bottom-line results that surged from the prior year.Deposits, which will be closely tracked by investors this quarter following the failure of three US banks in March, rose 1.5% over the quarter at JPMorgan. Compared to the same period last year, however, deposits fell 7%.In the company\\'s earnings release, CEO Jamie Dimon said, \"the U.S. economy continues to be on generally healthy footings—consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon, and the banking industry turmoil adds to these risks.\"Wells Fargo also reported top- and bottom-line results that rose against the prior year, with revenues topping $20.7 billion in the first quarter.Consumer deposits fell 5% from the prior year while commercial banking deposits were off 15% from the first quarter of 2022. Wells Fargo reported its loans extended to commercial clients rose 15% from the same period last year.Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in a release, \"We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the U.S. financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry.\"Citi reported income and revenue that rose 7% and 12% from the prior year, respectively, while highlighting its deposits stood at $1.3 trillion at end of the quarter, \"largely unchanged\" from the prior year, the company said in its release. CEO Jane Fraser said the company\\'s performance came \"despite the tumultuous environment for banks.\"Elsewhere on the earnings side, BlackRock\\'s (BLK) results showed the impact last year\\'s market turmoil had on investors as the firm\\'s average assets under management dipped below $9 trillion during the first quarter, down from $9.7 trillion in the same quarter last year. Revenue at the asset management giant also fell 10% from last year to $4.24 billion.\"BlackRock is a source of both stability and optimism for clients,\" CEO Larry Fink said in a release. \"We are helping clients navigate volatility and embed resiliency in their portfolios, while also providing insights on the longterm opportunities to be had in today\\'s markets.\"Elsewhere on the earnings calendar, shares of UnitedHealthcare (UNH) fell more than 2% after the company reported results that topped estimates and raised its 2023 full-year outlook.Shares of Boeing (BA) weighed on the Dow as the stock fell more than 5% on Friday after the company announced it would halt deliveries for some 737 Max planes.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated Quotes'],\n",

       "  'The IMF is recommending the Biden administration rein in spending to better balance the United States\\' debt load and help the Federal Reserve\\'s efforts to tamp down inflation.\"It seems clear to me that from the viewpoint of medium and long-term prospects, there is a very strong case for fiscal adjustment in the US,\" Vitor Gaspar, Director of the IMF\\'s Fiscal Affairs Department, told Yahoo Finance in an interview.\"It also seems opportune as a way of helping the Fed in the fight against inflation, thereby moderating necessary increases in interest rates.\"Inflation has proven to be more persistent over than many economists had expected over the last two years, with the latest Consumer Price Index showing prices excluding volatile food and energy categories rose 5.6% over last year in March.Over the past year, the Fed has embarked on its fastest rate-hiking campaign since the late 1980s, raising its benchmark interest rate 4.75 percentage points. The fed funds rate now stands in a range of 4.75%-5%, the highest level since 2007. Investors expect the Fed to raise rates another 0.25% next month.At the same time, the US government\\'s debt load projected to increase exceed the peak of the pandemic by 2027. The IMF estimates the US debt as a percentage of GDP will stand at 135% in 2028 with the deficit projected at 6.8% — both significantly outpacing other advanced economies.In his first two years in office, President Biden approved nearly $2 trillion in new spending. The president signed a more than $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law that put new funds into roads, bridges, transportation, broadband, and utilities in 2021. Last year, Biden also signed a sweeping $750 billion health care, tax, and climate bill dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act.The president has proposed a nearly $7 trillion budget for 2024 that calls for reducing deficits by around $3 trillion over the next decade by raising taxes on wealthy individuals and large corporations.\"We believe that fiscal tightening by moderating aggregate demand makes it easier for central banks to deliver inflation at target in a timely way in the sense that the required increase in policy rates is less,\" Gaspar said.Without the US, advanced economies would actually have a declining public debt to GDP ratio over the medium term, according to Gaspar. As rates rise, higher debt levels also means servicing higher interest costs on that debt.Gaspar argues moderating interest rate increases also helps with financial stability because rate hikes can cause fragilities in the financial system, as seen by recent bank failures in the US.Aside from helping monetary policy and staving off shocks to the economy, the IMF argues government spending cuts would help rebuild fiscal coffers that were used to respond to COVID and other economic shocks in recent years. The IMF also argues exercising fiscal restraint frees up cash to fight against climate change.One of the \"fiscal cliffs\" facing the US is raising the nation\\'s borrowing limit in a timely fashion. Gaspar says waiting until the last minute to raise the debt ceiling creates unnecessary uncertainty and volatility, which creates issues for not just the US but the global economy.\"Anything that can be done to minimize uncertainty and volatility and that would include a quick resolution of this political process around the debt ceiling would be welcome in the past,\" argues Gaspar.House Republicans are demanding spending cuts in exchange for raising the nation\\'s borrowing limit, but the White House has said it won\\'t negotiate on paying for what the government already agreed to spend.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is reportedly planning to propose a plan next week that would suspend the debt ceiling for a year in return for a party wish list of spending cuts and regulations. While it has little chance of being enacted, it could serve as the opening overture for future budget talks.Click here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisionsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance'],\n",

Over the last six months job gains have averaged 334,000 per month.When it comes to credit conditions, Waller said it\\'s unclear to what extent stress in the banking system following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank will dampen economic growth.\"Perhaps even more closely than usual, I will be watching the data to evaluate the appropriate path of monetary policy,\" he said. \"I say this because, all else equal, a significant tightening of credit conditions could obviate the need for some additional monetary policy tightening, but making such a judgement is difficult, especially in real time.\"In the past few weeks, Waller said deposit flows have stabilized across banks while usage of the Fed\\'s discount window and lending program has moderated.Waller called SVB\\'s failure a \"classic bank run.\"\"SVB seems to have done a terrible job managing its risks,\" Waller said.The Fed is expected to release a report on the failure of SVB by May 1.Click here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisionsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance'],\n",

Crypto-exposed stocks including Coinbase (COIN), Block (SQ), and MicroStrategy (MSTR) were all higher on Thursday.The March read on producer prices out Thursday morning also showed some additional moderation in inflation pressures last month, news taken by investors as a potential sign the Federal Reserve may be closer to ending its rate-hiking campaign sooner than expected.Producer prices fell 0.5% in March and rose just 2.7% over the prior year. The BLS said in its release that two-thirds of the drop in producer prices were attributable to a 1% decline in prices for goods, largely driven by gas prices falling last month. On a \"core\" basis, which excludes the volatile costs of food and energy, producer prices rose 0.1% last month.Labor market data out Thursday morning also suggested the job market continues to soften, with initial filings for unemployment insurance totaling 239,000 for the week ended April 8, the highest since January 2022, according to the government\\'s latest data.\"Initial jobless claims rose last week, but the labor market stayed tight. We expect claims to trend higher through the rest of the year and peak in Q4 as the economy begins to emerge from a mild recession,\" wrote Oren Klachkin, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Thursday. \"The upcoming labor market downturn will be modest since the drop in demand will be fairly modest and the labor pool will stay relatively small.\"On the earnings side, investors are bracing for Friday morning\\'s rush of bank earnings with JPMorgan (JPM), Citi (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) each expected to report results.Quarterly results from Delta Air Lines (DAL) served as the corporate highlight early Thursday, with these results showing the company missed Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Delta shares fell 1.1% on the session.Delta CEO Ed Bastian told Yahoo Finance on Thursday that \"given all the uncertainty and some of the volatility that we see and what seasonally is our weakest quarter of the year, we were quite pleased and thought it was a real solid performance.\"Stocks fell on Wednesday after the minutes from the Federal Reserve\\'s latest policy meeting showed some officials forecasting the economy tipping into recession later in 2023.\"For some time, the forecast for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff had featured subdued real GDP growth for this year and some softening in the labor market,\" the minutes read.\"Given their assessment of the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments, the staff\\'s projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years.\"The minutes ultimately revealed, however, that Fed officials were largely convinced the banking system would remain stable after multiple banks failed last month, likely keeping the central bank on track to raise interest rates again next month.\"The March FOMC minutes show that two weeks after the SVB failure, policymakers were still more worried, net, about upside inflation risk than the risk of a much sharper slowing in activity than they previously expected,\" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients on Wednesday.\"We doubt that this stance will survive contact with the incoming data over the next couple months.\"Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated Quotes'],\n",

       "  'Biden moves to expand Obamacare and Medicaid for Dreamers',\n",
       "  '2023-04-13',\n",
       "  \"While the fate of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Act is currently in limbo, the Biden administration announced Thursday that it would expand health care coverage for DACA recipients — commonly known as Dreamers — by allowing them to enroll in a health care plan through Obamacare or Medicaid.“Health care should be a right, not a privilege,” President Joe Biden said in his announcement. “My administration has worked hard to expand health care. And today, more Americans have health insurance than ever. Today’s announcement is about giving DACA recipients the same opportunity.”DACA, which was put into place by then-President Barack Obama in 2012, shields undocumented individuals who were brought into the country as children from deportation and allows them to obtain work authorization. Recipients are currently barred from accessing the health care marketplace, as they do not qualify for most federal benefits.Roughly 34% of Dreamers currently lack health care coverage, according to the National Immigration Law Center.Through Biden’s proposal, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would propose a rule that amends its definition of “lawful presence” to allow DACA recipients to qualify. Those who qualify may also be eligible for financial assistance based on income and their state Medicaid agency, and all eligibility information will be verified electronically, according to a White House fact sheet.“We recognize that every day counts, and we expect to get this done by the end of the month,” the White House stated.There are currently 589,660 DACA recipients as of Sept. 30, 2022, according to data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), with a large number residing in California and Texas.Texas is currently leading a coalition of states in challenging the validity of DACA in federal court. In the summer of 2021, U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen deemed DACA unlawful, a ruling that was later upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022.Under Hanen's ruling, current DACA recipients are able to renew their enrollment, but the government is now blocked from approving first-time applications. The same coalition of states is asking Hanen to also block renewal applications from current Dreamers.Despite bipartisan support among Americans and even politicians for providing a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, Congress has been unable to pass legislation that would do so.“It’s past time for Congress to give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship,” Biden said. “And while we work toward that goal — alongside Dreamers, advocates, members of Congress — we need to give Dreamers the opportunities and support they deserve.”—Adriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.

       "  'Mortgage rates declined, slightly, for the fifth consecutive week, easing homebuyers\\' borrowing costs just in time for the spring buying season.But one major problem remains - there is just not enough inventory on the market. And low supply continues to keep home prices elevated.The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage had a minor dip to 6.27% from 6.28% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have been sliding since early March, declining nearly half a point since March 2nd. U.S. Inflation also eased last month, with consumer index price (CPI) recording just a 0.1% rise in March, a further decline of 0.5% rise in February; the current index showed an annual inflation increase of 5%, the lowest since May 2021.Although the drop in rates and cooling inflation help potential homebuyers, lack of inventory continues to be the most significant housing challenge. Sellers aren\\'t motivated to list their properties. One reason: more than 85% of homeowners with mortgages with locked in rates below 5% and wouldn\\'t be able to buy a new home with the same or lower rate elsewhere. In other words: buying a new property would mean getting new mortgage loans with rates over 6%.\"With fewer homeowners putting homes up for sale, gains in the number of options for buyers have slowed.\" Danielle Hale, the chief economist at Realtor.com, said, \"With both homebuyers and potential sellers feeling rather dour about the real estate market, especially with respect to the outlook for mortgage rates, the number of homes sold will continue to be lower than one year ago for the next few months\"The bottom line A homebuyer who purchased a median-priced home of $386,797 with a 20% downpayment would pay an extra $791 in monthly mortgage compared to a year ago. The borrower would have the same principal balance but would be paying $1,617 a month with today’s rate at 6.27%, versus paying $825 with interest rate of 3.2% in January 2022.\"Existing homeowners have a disincentive to sell because every dollar borrowed costs more,\" Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial Corporation, previously told Yahoo Finance. \"The financially rational decision is not to sell.\"One mortgage expert believe that sellers would have to see a significant change in the mortgage rates to jump ship,“If I have a 3% mortgage, trading to a 6.25% mortgage isn\\'t all that attractive.” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of the mortgage website HSH.com, wrote, “If the leap is less, say to 4.5%, that might be more workable, and especially if I don\\'t need to increase (or increase by much) the size of the mortgage I\\'ll need to carry to make the move.”Market inventory increased 15.3% on a year-to-year basis to 980,000 units towards the end of February, and increased from 850,000 units compared to prior year. However, this level of activity is still at a ‘historical low’, according to the National Association of Realtors. There\\'s currently a 2.6-month supply of homes; a robust market has a around 6-month supply.Rebecca is a reporter for Yahoo Finance and previously worked as an investment tax certified public accountant (CPA).Click here for the latest personal finance news to help you with investing, paying off debt, buying a home, retirement, and moreRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance'],\n",

Officials expressed concern about the banking sector problems and scaled back their expectations for rate hikes, while some even considered pausing the rate hikes.Data earlier in the day provided an improving picture on the state of inflation in the U.S. The March consumer price index showed price gains cooled last month in the slowest rise since May 2021. The consumer price index rose 0.1% in March, a slower pace than the 0.4% gain in February. March\\'s headline inflation rose at an annual clip of 5.0%, below expectations of 5.2%.Core CPI, which strips out food and energy, grew 5.6%, in line with expectations. Meanwhile, housing costs are still a key driver of inflation, according to the BLS data, even as the residential market stabilizes.“Today’s CPI takes some heat off the Fed, for now.

That moved down slightly compared to before the CPI report\\'s release.The latest Fedspeak came from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly on Wednesday. Daly made remarks for the first time since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, an institution that was under the supervision of the San Francisco Fed.

       "  'By Howard SchneiderWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Several Federal Reserve policymakers last month considered pausing interest rate increases after the failure of two regional banks and a forecast from Fed staff that banking sector stress would tip the economy into recession.But even they concluded high inflation remained so paramount they pressed on with a rate hike despite the risk.After an unexpectedly complex debate that reshaped some policy views in real time, the dramatic developments after the March 10 failure of Silicon Valley Bank ultimately did little to derail the Fed\\'s rate-hike campaign, with officials convinced they could battle inflation with one set of tools and stabilize financial markets with others.\"Several participants ... considered whether it would be appropriate to hold the target range steady at the meeting\" to assess how financial sector developments might influence lending and the path of the economy, according to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s March 21-22 meeting, which were released on Wednesday.Fed staff assessing the potential fallout of banking sector stress projected a \"mild recession\" starting later this year, with a recovery in 2024-2025, the minutes showed.Even so, those several Fed policymakers who debated a pause ended up supporting the central bank\\'s quarter-percentage-point rate increase, agreeing along with other policymakers that actions taken by U.S. financial regulators and the Fed had \"helped calm conditions in the banking sector and lessen the near-term risks to economic activity and inflation,\" the minutes said.Inflation, meanwhile, \"remained well above the Committee\\'s longer-run goal of 2%,\" and Fed officials \"concurred ... that the recent data on inflation provided few signs that inflation pressures were abating at a pace sufficient to return inflation to 2% over time.\"The minutes showed a committee forced by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank into an unexpectedly complex debate, but ultimately moving forward with higher interest rates.\"Some participants noted ...they would have considered a 50-basis-point increase ... in the absence of the recent developments in the banking sector,\" the minutes said. \"Participants agreed that recent banking developments would factor into the Committee\\'s monetary policy decisions to the extent these developments affect the outlook for employment and inflation and the risks surrounding the outlook.\"Most Fed policymakers since the March meeting, with the notable exception of Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, have concentrated their remarks on the need to bring down inflation rather than the risk of tightening credit conditions.Policymakers at the March meeting did weaken their commitment to further rate hikes, dropping the stated need for \"ongoing increases\" from the policy statement in favor of saying only that \"some further\" tightening would likely be needed.It was clear from the minutes that the failures of SVB and Signature Bank introduced a new sense of caution, with officials ditching consideration of half point hikes, and indicating financial stability issues would be closely watched.Projections published at the meeting show most policymakers expect to need to deliver one more interest-rate hike before stopping.\"Participants observed that inflation remained much too high and that the labor market remained too tight; as a result they anticipated that some additional policy firming may be appropriate,\" the minutes said.Financial markets were little changed after the minutes.\"I didn’t see anything new that was so significant in this FOMC report that is going to change my mind about anything. They are going 25 and then they are going to pause,\\' said Ken Polcari of Kace Capital Advisors.(Reporting by Howard Schneider with reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Paul Simao and Chizu Nomiyama)'],\n",

       "  'Warren Buffett restored confidence in banks during the 2008 financial crisis. On Wednesday he offered up some new words of assurance about the turmoil that gripped regional banks in March.People \"do not need to be panicked\" about the industry and \"nobody is going to lose money on a deposit in a U.S. bank,\" the billionaire who runs Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) said in an interview with CNBC. \"It\\'s not going to happen.\"These were the first public comments from the \"Oracle of Omaha\" in the month since federal regulators seized Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank following deposit runs at both institutions.The failures, the second- and third-largest in U.S. history, triggered panic that more lenders could be equally vulnerable. Regulators, including the FDIC, stabilized the situation by promising to protect depositors and free up more liquidity for other regional lenders.The FDIC insures depositors up to $250,000 per account and pledged to cover even uninsured depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The costs of the FDIC fund used to backstop depositors, Buffett added, comes from banks and not from taxpayer money.\"Banks have never cost the federal government a dime. The public doesn’t understand that.\"Buffett downplayed any comparison to the crisis in 2008, noting that in this case some banks mismanaged their assets and liabilities. \"Some of the dumb things banks do periodically have been uncovered during this period,\" said Buffett. But \"they haven\\'t made the same sort of mistakes as they made back in 2008.\"He also warned that banks can lose the confidence of the public in seconds and that more could in fact go down. \"We’re not over bank failures.\"Buffett has played the role of savior in past banking crises. During the debacle of 2008, Goldman Sachs Group (GS) came to him seeking capital and his stamp of approval. Buffett injected $5 billion into Goldman.He then injected another $5 billion into Bank of America (BAC) in 2011, when Brian Moynihan was still a relatively new chief executive and the lender’s shares were under pressure due to losses from subprime loans. He is still a large shareholder of Bank of America.It was also Buffett who suggested in 2008 to then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson that the federal government should inject capital into banks to stabilize the industry. That became an official proposal of $250 billion, even though some of the biggest banks insisted they didn’t need the money.Reuters reported last month that Buffett had discussions with the Biden administration about the banks.

The Fed has been raising interest rates to try to bring down inflation, but the central bank risks sending the economy into a recession by hiking rates too high too fast.\"If I think about the economic outlook as four potential scenarios: (1) soft-landing, (2) recession, (3) continued overheating, (4) stagflation – the odds of stagflation went down while the odds of soft-landing went up. Good news for stocks,\" Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, wrote in reaction to the report on Wednesday.On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in March climbed 0.4% over the prior month and 5.6% over last year. Both measures were in-line with economist expectations, according to Bloomberg data.Core inflation remained especially sticky last month amid surging rents. The index for rent and the index for owners’ equivalent rent both rose 0.5% in March following larger increases in the previous month. Owners\\' equivalent rent is the hypothetical rent a homeowner would pay.The shelter index increased 8.2% over the last year, accounting for over 60% of the total increase in core inflation.U.S. stocks edged higher following the release of the data. Treasury yields initially moved to the upside, but then fell 7 basis points to around 3.36% at market open.The energy index decreased 6.4% for the 12 months ending March, while the food index increased 8.5% over the last year. The energy index dropped 3.5% from February to March on a seasonally adjusted basis, led by a 4% drop in the price of fuel oil. Gas prices fell 4.6% from the prior month on a seasonally adjusted basis. They were down 17.4% annually.Food costs saw some reprieve in March with the food index unchanged while the food at home index fell 0.3%, the BLS noted.

       "  \"U.S. stocks wavered Tuesday, with the tech sector hiccuping as key inflation data and the start of earnings season loomed on the week's calendar.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was flat, reversing gains from earlier in the trading session. The\\xa0Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained about 0.3%, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dipped by 0.4%.Government bond yields were higher. The yield on the 10-year note edged up to 3.428%, while rate-sensitive two-year note yields rose to 4.033% Tuesday.Wall Street kicked off the week on a modestly upbeat note ahead of inflation data out on Wednesday and bank earnings on deck for Friday.That inflation data will dominate the headlines this week, with bank earnings also in sight. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect March’s consumer price index to climb 0.3% from February’s figure, lowering the year-over-year inflation rate to 5.2%.“This is the week that could tell us that the US consumer is no longer showing resilience and in fact is rather weak; core inflation is making things more expensive, retail sales might show the consumer is tapped out, and the banks might paint a picture that American savings accounts are down and credit card debt is skyrocketing,” OANDA analyst Edward Moya said in a note.This comes after the Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls rose by 236,000 in March, slightly below consensus estimates for 240,000. That's down from February's revised 326,000, the slowest since December 2020. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, while the labor force participation rate climbed to a post-COVID era high of 62.6%.With another strong jobs report in hand, investors are responding by changing their probability of another rate hike from the Fed at their next meeting. Markets are now pricing in a 68% probability that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by another 0.25% in May, according to data from the CME Group.Separately, the minutes from the Fed’s late-March meeting will be released on Wednesday, giving more insight into the central bank’s policy moves.This week’s main central bank policy decision will come from the Bank of Canada on Wednesday. Policymakers announced a pause in rate hikes at their meeting in January, and investors are anticipating that rates will remain unchanged.Elsewhere, global policymakers gathered in Washington for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings. The International Monetary Fund warned Tuesday of slowing global growth amid banking sector vulnerability. The IMF projects the global economy will expand at 2.8% this year, slightly lower than its January estimate of 2.9%.Also on Wall Street’s plate this week will be earnings from the bank heavyweights, including Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan (JPM), BlackRock (BLK), and Citi (C) on tap Friday. Banks have had a weak start to the year amid the sector's turmoil, with the KBW Banks Index (^BKX) down 20% this year.With the first-quarter season underway, tech stocks have made a sudden turnaround from an ugly 2022. Some analysts continue to see the upside ahead for the sector.“We continue to believe that Tech will be trading better this year than it did last, but at the same time, think that recent Tech run is getting stretched, in absolute terms,” Mislav Matejka, head of global and European equity strategy at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients. “It is looking overbought, close to all-time highs, with RSIs [relative strength index] that are nearing elevated territory.” And the question remains if tech will keep driving the market higher.On the economic front, optimism among small business owners fell below a 49-year average in March as inflation, tighter credit conditions, and difficulty finding workers weighed on outlook.Meanwhile, Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger spoke exclusively to New York Fed President John Williams on Tuesday.

       "  \"Optimism among small business owners fell below a 49-year average in March as inflation, tighter credit conditions and difficulty finding workers weighed on outlook.The National Federation of Independent Business' (NFIB) optimism index fell to 90.1 last month from 90.9 in February, the group said in a report Tuesday.“Small business owners are cynical about future economic conditions,” NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg wrote in the release. “Hiring plans fell to their lowest level since May 2020, but strong consumer spending has kept Main Street alive and supported strong labor demand.”Inflation remained the single most important issue impacting small businesses, with 24% of business owners flagging this as the biggest operational problem facing their companies.Meanwhile, labor was the second-biggest problem for small businesses, with 43% of all owners reporting that job openings were difficult to fill, the NFIB’s survey showed.The concern comes as new federal hiring data released Friday showed that the labor market continues to add jobs at a strong pace. Employers added 236,000 jobs in March while unemployment stayed low at 3.5%.According to NFIB's monthly jobs report, a seasonally\\xa0adjusted net 15% of owners are planning to add new jobs in the next three months. Still, about 26% of owners said they got few or no qualified applicants for their open positions.About 59% of small business owners reported hiring or trying to hire in March, down one point from last month, according to the NFIB survey. Yet, elevated labor costs have become a burden to small business operators, with 11% reporting the concern.Separately, a net 42% of small business owners said they raised compensation while about 22% plan to increase compensation in the next three months.As inflation is costing small businesses money, a net 37% of owners said they raised their selling prices, the lowest since April 2021. But some owners expect higher sales volume to deteriorate to a net 15% amid economic uncertainty.Still, more small businesses reported having greater difficulty getting a loan in March after multiple bank failures led to tightening credit conditions. A net 9% said their last loan was harder to get than the previous time, up 4 percentage points from the previous month.“The March survey ought to capture at least some of the impact of the banking crisis on small business owners’ confidence, and it’s not pretty; the decline in the headline index reverses the modest gain since the start of the year, and leaves it 12.4 points below its recent peak in June 2021,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote following the release.“Small businesses are captives of their banks, and the overnight change in the way markets view regional banks means they have been catapulted into survival and liquidity mode. Lending growth was slowing long before SVB failed, but the declines in the March NFIB measures of current and expected credit availability means we have to expect much weaker lending numbers over the next few months,” he added.Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

       "  \"The International Monetary Fund warned Tuesday the risk of a recession has grown for advanced economies in the wake of bank failures in the U.S. and Europe while slightly lowering its outlook for global growth this year.The IMF projects the global economy will expand at 2.8% this year, a hair lower than its January estimate of 2.9%.“With the recent increase in financial market volatility and multiple indicators pointing in different directions, the fog around the world economic outlook has thickened,” the international body said in its latest World Economic Outlook. “Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled.”The new forecast comes after IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said last week during a speech in Washington that global growth will expand less than 3% this year, citing rising geo-political tensions and inflation.In Tuesday's report, the IMF warned that there's significant risk that recent banking system turbulence \\xa0could\\xa0spread to the broader economy and hurt business and consumer confidence.“A hard landing— particularly for advanced economies—has become a much larger risk,” according to the report.Overall, the IMF put the probability that global growth falls below 2% this year at 25% – an outcome that’s only happened five times, including during the financial crisis and the pandemic.“Recession concerns have gained prominence, while worries about stubbornly high inflation persist,” said the report.Growth in advanced economies is projected to decline by half this year to 1.3%, before rising to 1.4% next year. About 90% of advanced economies are projected to see growth drop this year.Global headline inflation is estimated to drop to 7% this year from 8.7% in 2022, as oil prices fall and higher interest rates slow inflation. Meanwhile, core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is expected to decline more gradually, ticking down just 0.2 percentage point from last year to 6.2%.The IMF said policymakers have a narrow path to walk to bring down inflation while avoiding a recession and maintaining financial stability.The report also said that growth is projected to rise to 3% next year and remain at that level for the next five years. That marks the lowest medium-term growth forecast since 1990 and reflects an expected decline in population growth.During the two pre-pandemic decades — 2000–2009 and 2010–2019 — world growth averaged 3.9% and 3.7% a year, respectively.Click here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisionsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\"],\n",

       "  \"U.S. stocks wavered Monday as stocks reversed early-session losses after the release of Friday's jobs report showed continued strength in the labor market.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.3%, ending the day on an upbeat note.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dipped just below the flatline.Government bonds yields were higher. The yield on the 10-year note climbed to 3.42%, while rate-sensitive two-year note yields gained to 4.01% Monday.Crude oil (CL=F) slipped below $80 a barrel Monday after hovering around that level most of the last few days.Wall Street last Thursday wrapped up a short but volatile week, ending on a modestly upbeat note ahead of Friday's jobs report. Stocks had been wobbly earlier in the week in response to signs of a slowing economy, including weak data on private payrolls and job openings.The stock market was closed for Good Friday. Still, the Labor Department on Friday reported that nonfarm payrolls rose by 236,000 in March, slightly below consensus estimates for 240,000 and down from February's revised 326,000. The unemployment rate was steady at 3.5%, while the labor force participation rate climbed to a post-COVID era high of 62.6%.Hourly earnings rose 0.3% compared to February’s figures. The annual gain cooled to 4.2%, below February’s 4.6%.“The March jobs report suggests the US labor market is moving into a healthier balance as softer employment growth and cooler wage inflation suggest we're nearing the end of the Fed's rate hiking cycle,” Ryan Sweet, Chief US Economist at Oxford Economics, wrote after Friday’s report.Following the release, markets are now pricing in a 65% probability that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by another 0.25% in May, according to data from the CME Group.Meanwhile, this week Wall Street will be closely paying attention to March’s consumer price index report out Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the index to rise 0.3% from February, lowering the year-over-year headline inflation rate to 5.2%.“Thinking about the near-term setup, investors remain bearish, and the recession narrative was the dominant narrative last week as bad news was treated as bad news,” wrote the U.S. market intelligence team at JPMorgan in a note. “The CPI print should give more certainty around the terminal rate.”Minutes from the Fed’s late-March meeting will be released on Wednesday, giving more insight into the central bank’s policy moves.Another potential catalyst for markets could come at the end of the week. Some of the bank heavyweights including Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan (JPM), and Citi (C) will report earnings.Under this backdrop, commercial lending has fallen more than $100 billion over the last two weeks of March, the largest dip on record, heightening the focus on bank earnings this week.Meanwhile, as corporate earnings season kicks off, analysts anticipate companies in the S&P 500 to post a second consecutive slide in quarterly profits. First-quarter estimates have been sharply reduced to 6.8% from the same period a year ago, according to FactSet.On the economic front, wholesale inventories were $919.2 billion at the end of February, up 0.1% from January's level, and below consensus estimates of 0.2%. Sales for the month rose 0.4%, lower than the expected 0.6% gain, the Commerce Department reported. Separately, households project that inflation a year from now would stand at 4.7% compared February's reading of 4.2%, the first increase since October, according to a report from the New York Fed's March Survey of Consumer Expectations. Meanwhile, New York Fed President John Williams is expected to take part on Monday in moderated discussion hosted by The Economics Review at New York University.In single-stock moves, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) shares moved down after the EV maker confirmed plans to build a major battery production site in Shanghai.Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD) shares soared after a report from The Wall Street Journal hinted that Exxon Mobil held talks with the shale driller about a possible acquisition.Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell 1.6% Monday after the company reported that their personal computer shipments tanked by 40% in the first quarter, signaling a bumpy start to the year for PC makers.Micron Technology, Inc.

       "  'Masters winner Jon Rahm showcased Topgolf Callaway Brands (MODG) all weekend at Augusta National, and one analyst sees several tailwinds for the stock.\"We believe the market has yet to fully appreciate Topgolf Callaway Brands\\' transformation into a preeminent golf entertainment platform,\" Jefferies analyst Randy Konik wrote in a client note published on Monday. \"Topgolf is a high-quality asset with scarcity value, enabling Topgolf Callaway Brands to widen its total addressable market (TAM) and augment its growth algorithm. Tailwinds to golf remain favorable and Topgolf Callaway Brands is uniquely positioned to capitalize on growing interest in the sport.\"Konik\\'s $56 price target on the stock assumes 171% upside from current levels.Callaway lured Rahm away from rival Taylormade with a multi-year sponsorship contract in 2021.The 28-year old Spaniard won the Masters using Callaway\\'s new Paradym woods, Apex irons, Jaws wedges, and Chromesoft balls. Rahm\\'s golf bag was emblazoned with the Callaway logo, while the strap bore Topgolf — the golf experience brand Callaway bought for $2.66 billion in 2021.Rahm is among a host of other up-and-coming, high-profile golfers Callaway sponsors, including Sam Burns and Xander Schauffele.Despite Callaway\\'s youthful team performing generally well on the links — which lends itself to prominent placement on TV and social media — shares have lost about 8% in the past year. The stock trades at a 20% discount to its five-year average enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio.Jefferies\\' Konik thinks the stock price reflects a \"pressured consumer,\" rising interest rates, and recession fears weighing on pricey equipment sales. To that end, through the first two months of the season golf rounds played are up only 1.8% compared to 2022 according to data from the National Golf Foundation.At the same time, Konik listed several reasons Topgolf Callaway Brands stock looks too good to ignore.First, population demographics are favorable to the golf industry.Konik estimated that 60-plus year olds represent nearly half of annual rounds played and a greater portion of annual golf equipment spending. With current population projections suggesting the number of people aged 70-74 will hit 18.8 million in 2035 (compared with 14.8 million in 2020), it stands to reason that will drive a meaningful lift in golf equipment sales that should benefit Topgolf Callaway Brands.Second, Konik noted that since 2013 the average major club launch price has moved up an \"impressive\" $180, or 46%, from $390 to $570.\"In our view, the consumer has given original equipment manufacturers permission to continue to push the envelope, in terms of price, so long as there is sufficient innovation to back it,\" Konik wrote.Third, Konik believes investors do not \"appreciate\" the growth potential of the Topgolf and apparel brand TravisMathew under Callaway\\'s tent. Topgolf Callaway Brands recently lifted its estimate for Topgolf unit potential to 250 from 200, and TravisMathew is on track for $1 billion in sales — up from $300 million in 2022.\"In our view, it\\'s a hidden gem,\" Konik wrote of TravisMathew.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance\\'s Executive Editor.

       "  \"U.S. stocks wavered Monday as stocks reversed early-session losses after the release of Friday's jobs report showed continued strength in the labor market.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.3%, ending the day on an upbeat note.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dipped just below the flatline.Government bonds yields were higher. The yield on the 10-year note climbed to 3.42%, while rate-sensitive two-year note yields gained to 4.01% Monday.Crude oil (CL=F) slipped below $80 a barrel Monday after hovering around that level most of the last few days.Wall Street last Thursday wrapped up a short but volatile week, ending on a modestly upbeat note ahead of Friday's jobs report. Stocks had been wobbly earlier in the week in response to signs of a slowing economy, including weak data on private payrolls and job openings.The stock market was closed for Good Friday. Still, the Labor Department on Friday reported that nonfarm payrolls rose by 236,000 in March, slightly below consensus estimates for 240,000 and down from February's revised 326,000. The unemployment rate was steady at 3.5%, while the labor force participation rate climbed to a post-COVID era high of 62.6%.Hourly earnings rose 0.3% compared to February’s figures. The annual gain cooled to 4.2%, below February’s 4.6%.“The March jobs report suggests the US labor market is moving into a healthier balance as softer employment growth and cooler wage inflation suggest we're nearing the end of the Fed's rate hiking cycle,” Ryan Sweet, Chief US Economist at Oxford Economics, wrote after Friday’s report.Following the release, markets are now pricing in a 65% probability that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by another 0.25% in May, according to data from the CME Group.Meanwhile, this week Wall Street will be closely paying attention to March’s consumer price index report out Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the index to rise 0.3% from February, lowering the year-over-year headline inflation rate to 5.2%.“Thinking about the near-term setup, investors remain bearish, and the recession narrative was the dominant narrative last week as bad news was treated as bad news,” wrote the U.S. market intelligence team at JPMorgan in a note. “The CPI print should give more certainty around the terminal rate.”Minutes from the Fed’s late-March meeting will be released on Wednesday, giving more insight into the central bank’s policy moves.Another potential catalyst for markets could come at the end of the week. Some of the bank heavyweights including Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan (JPM), and Citi (C) will report earnings.Under this backdrop, commercial lending has fallen more than $100 billion over the last two weeks of March, the largest dip on record, heightening the focus on bank earnings this week.Meanwhile, as corporate earnings season kicks off, analysts anticipate companies in the S&P 500 to post a second consecutive slide in quarterly profits. First-quarter estimates have been sharply reduced to 6.8% from the same period a year ago, according to FactSet.On the economic front, wholesale inventories were $919.2 billion at the end of February, up 0.1% from January's level, and below consensus estimates of 0.2%. Sales for the month rose 0.4%, lower than the expected 0.6% gain, the Commerce Department reported. Separately, households project that inflation a year from now would stand at 4.7% compared February's reading of 4.2%, the first increase since October, according to a report from the New York Fed's March Survey of Consumer Expectations. Meanwhile, New York Fed President John Williams is expected to take part on Monday in moderated discussion hosted by The Economics Review at New York University.In single-stock moves, Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) shares moved down after the EV maker confirmed plans to build a major battery production site in Shanghai.Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD) shares soared after a report from The Wall Street Journal hinted that Exxon Mobil held talks with the shale driller about a possible acquisition.Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) fell 1.6% Monday after the company reported that their personal computer shipments tanked by 40% in the first quarter, signaling a bumpy start to the year for PC makers.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) shares surged 8% after Samsung Electronics said it plans to make meaningful cuts to chip production amid hammered prices across the industry.—Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But ‘R’ as in recession, as in a contraction in economic growth.I know what you are probably wondering. How is this guy going to pontificate about a recession following a month that created 236,000 headline jobs? How is this guy going to warn the investing masses about a recession when shares of Nvidia are up 85% year to date, followed not too closely behind by an 80% surge in Meta?All of that is precisely why I am bringing up recession. Well, that and because economic data is beginning to soften.April has brought with it rain showers, a miss on ISM manufacturing data, a miss on job openings data, and a miss on the ADP employment report. The GDPNow read on economic growth from the Atlanta Fed has also ticked lower.“We are seeing cracks in the labor market,” John Hancock Investment Management Co-Chief Investment Strategist Emily Roland told me, Seana Smith, and Brad Smith moments after the jobs report on Yahoo Finance Live.The aforementioned jobs increase for March was below the year-to-date average increase of 344,000, let’s keep in mind.Roland thinks we are still likely to get a recession this year and acknowledges we are headed into a “tricky” part of the economic cycle.Meanwhile, Samsung warned on Friday about a semiconductor glut. Several weeks ago, Micron offered up a similar vibe when it reported earnings.Despite the fresh warnings, those aforementioned tech names – and even speculative AI names such as SoundHound — continue to push higher. Many investors are ignoring what looks to be a slowdown in the economy fueled in part by the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes (one more is on the way soon, RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas tells us).Not all investors are overlooking it, as seen in the strong moves in gold and silver prices, and utilities and consumer staples stocks. But enough are to call it out.Bottom line: this is not an official recession call from Yahoo Finance, we don’t do that stuff. Besides, it’s damn near impossible to pick successful stocks and economic cycles. All I am asking is that you pay attention to the new messages the economy is throwing off – it will matter to your wealth, believe me.Happy Trading!Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\"],\n",

       "  'Housing market data in recent weeks has offered some signs of stabilization as the spring selling season begins to ramp up.Mortgage rates are on the downswing, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage dipping to 6.28% from 6.32% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac. This marked the fourth straight weekly drop as the bank crisis that began four weeks ago has pressured Treasury rates.The slide in rates also comes as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point in March as it continues its aggressive campaign to cool rapid inflation.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which is closely tracked by the average 30-year mortgage rate, stood at 3.41% at the end of the week, down from 4% at the beginning of March.\"While access to commercial mortgage loans could become increasingly difficult, residential mortgage loans are expected to be more readily available,\" National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a press release.Mortgage applications fell 4.1% during the week ending March 31, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association out last week.Before this drop mortgage applications had risen for four straight weeks.\"Mortgage rates no longer are rising, but they likely will remain elevated for some time,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a recent note to clients. \"That leaves [home] prices to do the heavy lifting if affordability is to improve; prices have fallen by about 5% since the summer, but we look for a further 15% decline over the next year, restoring the pre-Covid price-to-income ratio.\"Here\\'s a roundup of where major housing data stands through the first few months of 2023.Signed contracts to buy existing homes in the U.S. rose in February, the third-straight monthly increase, according to data released March 29 by the National Association of Realtors.Contract signings increased in all regions of the country except for the West. Pending sales jumped 6.5% from last month in the Northeast, notched a 0.4% gain in the Midwest, and a 0.7% increase in the South; out West pending home sales fell 2.4%.\"The affordable U.S. regions — the Midwest and South — are leading the recovery,\" Yun said.Confidence among U.S. home builders rose slightly in March, the third-straight month builders have increased their optimism about the U.S. housing market.The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo\\'s index of builder sentiment increased 2 points to 44, figures released March 15 showed. Analysts had expected this index to come in at a reading of 40.\"Even as builders continue to deal with stubbornly high construction costs and material supply chain disruptions, they continue to report strong pent-up demand as buyers are waiting for interest rates to drop and turning more to the new home market due to a shortage of existing inventory,\" NAHB Chairman Alicia Huey, a custom home builder and developer from Birmingham, Ala, wrote in the press release.Housing starts rose 9.8% in February to an annualized rate of 1.45 million homes, the strongest pace of starts since last September, the Commerce Department said March 16. Housing starts for single family homes advanced 1.1% to an annualized rate of 830,000, while multi-family housing starts surged 24% to a rate of 608,000. Starts grew in all regions except the Northeast in February.Existing home sales in February jumped 14.5% to an annualized rate of 4.58 million, the largest monthly percentage increase since July 2020, data from the National Association of Realtors out March 21 showed. This increase also marked the end of a 12-month slide.The annualized rate of existing homes sold topped the 4.2 million expected by economists, according to Bloomberg data. The median sales price for an existing home slid 0.2% to $363,000, compared to a year ago, NAR data showed.\"We\\'re seeing stronger sales gains in areas where home prices are decreasing and the local economies are adding jobs,\" Yun said.About 57% of homes sold in February were on the market for less than a month.New single-family home sales rose 1.1% in February to an annualized pace of 640,000, up from January’s rate of 633,000 according to a report from the Census Bureau released March 23. This figure was 19% below the pace seen a year ago.The median sales price of a new home in February stood at $438,200, while the average sales price reached $498,700.At the end of the month, there was a seasonally-adjusted estimate of 436,000 new homes for sale in the market, representing about 8 months of supply at the current sales rate.Zillow Senior Economist Orphe Divounguy wrote in a statement that low inventory suggested \"builders still likely face challenges in completing units while buyer demand has also ticked up.\"The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price index fell 0.5% in January compared to the previous month, according to data released on March 28. On a yearly basis, the index climbed 3.8% in January, down from 5.6% in the previous month.The report\\'s 20-City Composite index, which tracks prices in the 20 largest metros, showed prices fell 0.6% over the prior month in January and rose just 2.5% over last year. All 20 cities reported lower prices in the year ending January 2023 versus the year ending December 2022, the report said.Click here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisionsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated Quotes'],\n",

Or so investors hope.This week brought a host of misses on closely watched economic data — from the ADP employment report and ISM manufacturing data to JOLTs (the job openings report). Sure, with a 236,000 increase in March, the non-farm payrolls beat estimates slightly. But the figure was below the year-to-date average increase of 344,000 — so it also sort of tapped into the gloomier data mood.The subsequent vibe on Wall Street is that the economy may be hitting a soft patch after the March banking turmoil and after yet another interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.\"Risk-off sentiment has continued to grow in markets thanks to another round of weak data that’s added to fears about a potential U.S. recession,\" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid warned.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and S&P 500 (^GSPC) all saw buyer\\'s fatigue in the wake of the data letdowns.What didn\\'t lack interest? Safe-haven trades such as gold, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund, and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund. Oddly enough, speculative AI names like BigBear.ai (BBAI) and SoundHound (SOUN) caught bids (here\\'s what pros told me about this move).Amid all this activity, here are three things you may have missed this week.With the auto show in town, Yahoo Finance was working the scene all week to report on the latest and greatest in everything mobility.GM\\'s (GM) CFO Paul Jacobson told me over lunch that there are no plans to turn a car\\'s cockpit into one giant subscription service. That\\'s reassuring considering some automakers have pondered charging subscriptions for heated seats.And yes, Tesla came up at lunch — mostly from the view of GM looking to take a bite out of the EV leader\\'s rich profit margins in the category.Meanwhile, Yahoo Finance\\'s Dave Briggs found three hot trends in autos you need to know about; here\\'s Briggs from the auto show floor. Shout out to our friends at our sister publication Autoblog — I really enjoyed checking out these pics on new vehicle models.An old boss once told me to always be on the lookout for trends. In the spirit of that, I am tossing a red flag onto the field for the approaching earnings season in the semiconductor industry.With U.S. markets closed on Friday, Samsung (005930.KS) did its best to sneak in an under-the-radar major warning on its business. The chip giant said it would make a \"meaningful\" cut to its production amid still bloated inventory levels that are weighing on prices.This is the same bearish tone markets heard from fellow chip-maker Micron (MU) when it reported earnings a few weeks ago.None of this is a good setup for chip-maker earnings that begin trickling in later this month. I would argue it doesn\\'t augur well for results from PC makers such as HP Inc. and Dell, either.Even an upgrade on Intel (INTC) on Monday didn\\'t strike me as a \"screaming buy\" call on the stock.\"We have been decidedly negative on Intel\\'s prospects for quite some time, a stance clearly justified by the company\\'s utter collapse as a weakening market and poor decisions shaved billions off the top line, burned billions in cash, and crashed the stock price by almost 50% since CEO Pat Gelsinger arrived,\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote. \"But while things still look bad, tactically we believe the medium-term set-up is, finally, improving a bit, as the company\\'s issues are known, and numbers (for the first time in a while) may be low enough to stand.\"Believe me, after spending years covering the restaurant industry as a consumer reporter, a highly paid communications person at McDonald\\'s (MCD) wants nothing more in life than to see their beloved fast food brand mentioned favorably somewhere in media land.Since I am in a positive mood after my birthday, I have a morsel of happiness for folks at McDonald\\'s (and their investors) to chew on.Two calls on McDonald\\'s from a report by longtime restaurant analyst Andy Barish at Jefferies caught our attention:\"We continue to be encouraged by the Famous Meals platform as evidence of MCD\\'s powerful brand and marketing relevancy, not to mention the same-store sales upticks and opportunity for digital engagement with loyalty & mobile app usage, particularly among younger customers,\" Barish wrote. \"While we concede there is a limit to how many times they organize current menu items into a combo with a celebrity name attached and still expect big consumer buzz/sales results, Google search data indicates the recent Cardi B & Offset Meal starting on Valentine\\'s Day saw a similar level of attention as the successful J Balvin and Saweetie meals from Oct \\'20 and Aug \\'21, respectively, and only lagged the Travis Scott and BTS Meals (which had average tickets 50% lower or more given the Cardi B & Offset Meal is targeted for 2 people, and the BTS Meal likely benefited from a larger and younger worldwide fanbase).\"And then this:\"Google search data (below) also shows “chicken big mac” is trending well in the U.S. even though it isn\\'t available here...yet,\" the analyst added. \"This product is running as a limited-time offering in Canada, Ireland, and the UK. An August ’22 test in select Miami stores also generated a high level of Google search interest relative to MCD’s popular \\'Famous Meal\\' LTO platform. Should the Chicken Big Mac come to U.S. stores, especially as chicken breast prices moderate, we think it would see high demand.\"Another nugget: McDonald\\'s shares are up 7.3% year to date, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average\\'s 1% gain.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance\\'s Executive Editor.

SubscribeThe Federal Reserve has raised interest rates aggressively over the last year in a bid to slow inflation and the labor market.Its efforts are still not quite feeding through to the data. Friday\\'s March jobs report is the latest case in point.The U.S. economy created 236,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate fell back to 3.5%.As RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas said in an email on Friday, the labor market remains \"stout.\"With Friday\\'s data, the Fed is likely to raise rates by another 0.25% next month. The Fed\\'s forecasts published in March suggest that would mark the end of rate hikes for the Fed.Many economists, including Brusuelas, suspect this will indeed come to pass for the central bank. Brusuelas wrote, \"it is now appropriate to begin considering a \\'one and done\\' policy path at the Federal Reserve.\"Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic wrote Friday the March jobs report \"is supportive of another rate hike in May — which we think could be the last for the tightening cycle. Followed by a long pause.\"Over at Wells Fargo, economists Sarah House and Michael Pugliese wrote Friday, \"On balance, this is the type of employment report we believe policymakers at the FOMC want to see: job growth slowing in an orderly fashion, labor supply expanding and wage growth that is edging closer to rates that are consistent with the central bank\\'s 2% inflation target.\"The firm expects a rate hike in May, \"but it could be the last rate hike of the cycle as policymakers keep rates on hold for an extended period of time and let the medicine take.\"Indicators like a rise in initial jobless claims, a drop in open job listings, and layoff increases captured by Challenger Gray\\'s monthly report all suggest a slowing in the labor market — and the economy — that is consistent with the Fed being able to back off its rate hikes.And yet the notion that the economy is finally matching the Fed\\'s goal is one that has been simmering in markets for months.Only to be swatted away by the data at each turn.In late 2022, an economic slowdown seemed in the offing as monthly job gains fell below 300,000 from September through December. A surprise jobs report in January put more aggressive rate hikes back on the table.Just last month, a bank crisis seemed likely to push the Fed not only to stop raising rates but potentially roll back rate hikes. On March 22, the Fed raised rates another 0.25%.After inflation data that, like labor market data, is cooling but remains elevated and Friday\\'s strong jobs report, the market is expecting another rate hike next month.And so while economists are again circling the idea that now, finally, in this moment we\\'re ready to see the Fed pause, little over the last six months has suggested the U.S. economy is ready to put the Fed in position to back off.Some in markets will chide the Powell Fed for having been consistently wrong in their economic forecasts. Another bout of revisions to chase reality in 2023 would not silence these critics.But being wrong about the outlook has not stopped Powell & co. from acting on new information. And the notion that this Fed\\'s reaction function might change now could see investors again fall into the same trap all over again.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance'],\n",

       "  'Cryptocurrencies are pushing higher in 2023 despite a banking crisis, rising interest rates, and a slew of new legal and regulatory headaches for the fledgling industry.Bitcoin, the largest and best-known digital currency, rose 69% in the three months ending March 31, while ether, the second-largest, was up 51%. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently hovering near $28,000 while ether (ETH) on Wednesday climbed above $1,900 per coin, its highest level since September of last year. Both are relatively flat over the last 24 hours.Even Dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency that began as a joke, shot 30% higher Monday after Elon Musk swapped Twitter\\'s bird icon with the Dogecoin\\'s Shiba Inu logo. Doge forfeited some of these gains on Thursday when Twitter\\'s logo was swapped back.SkyBridge Capital Founder and Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci told Yahoo Finance Thursday, \"I would guess right now that we\\'re through the bear market\" in cryptocurrencies. \"If something happens to Binance,\" he said, referring to a crypto exchange experiencing new legal pressure from regulators, \"I think it will be a short-term hit.\"Skybridge had some challenges last year as some customers requested to withdraw their money. It also sold a 30% stake to crypto exchange FTX before the exchange collapsed. Total assets under management at Skybridge dropped to $1.8 billion at the end of 2022, down 50% from a year earlier and down 80% from a 2015 peak of $9.2 billion.But Scaramucci remains confident in his firm\\'s crypto investments. \"Any time that you\\'ve held bitcoin in a four-year rolling interval, so you pick the day, hold it for four years, you\\'ve outperformed every other asset class,\" Scaramucci said.The rapid climb of digital currencies is one of the year\\'s big surprises in markets after a crash in 2022 cost investors billions as higher interest rates and inflation lowered the value and appeal of risky assets.Several crypto players filed for bankruptcy, including FTX in November. FTX\\'s former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried now faces criminal charges that he stole billions of FTX customer funds and misled investors.\"It\\'s a bounce back from the really poor performance we saw in 2022,\" VettaFi research head Todd Rosenbluth told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.What gave the market added momentum this year, ironically, was a banking crisis in March that took down three lenders, including two that specifically served cryptocurrency customers.Some investors chose to seek out cryptocurrencies as a safe haven from the perceived instability of banking. Others anticipated the Fed might have to cut interest rates in response to the crisis, sparking more flows into alternative risk assets.Since March 10, the day regulators seized Silicon Valley Bank in the second-largest bank failure of U.S. history, bitcoin is up more than 33% and ether is up more than 26%. The total value for all crypto assets is up more than 22% during that period, as of Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.This year\\'s crypto comeback is unfolding even as Washington regulators step up their efforts to rein in this market.The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued 11 enforcement actions since the beginning of January against crypto firms and individuals, while serving formal letters to Paxos, DeFi exchange Sushi, and Coinbase Global (COIN) warning the agency plans to bring an enforcement action. Coinbase is the largest U.S. crypto exchange.Coinbase shares have rebounded 73% year to date but are still two thirds below their value a year ago.Another regulator, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, also has sued crypto exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao for allegedly selling derivatives backed by digital assets to U.S. customers despite not being registered to do so.\"This industry is not in a good trust position right now with the public, with investors, with customers,\" CFTC commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero said Wednesday at the Links NYC conference hosted by crypto firm Chainalysis.Goldsmith Romero noted that crypto firms are still grappling with issues \"learned\" from the collapse of FTX last November while regulators try to move fast to understand the technology. CFTC has worked enforcement cases with other agencies, \"and I think you’ll probably see more of those,\" she added.Another concern for some investors is that liquidity for major cryptocurrencies has fallen to record lows. Data from research firm Kaiko shows the ease of exchange between bitcoin and ether into cash has fallen a total 50% and 41% respectively since FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11.\"It makes me weary of any recent rally although bitcoin is quite close to $30K,\" Christopher Newhouse, a crypto derivatives trader with GSR, told Yahoo Finance.Newhouse said he worries everyday traders aren’t entering the market, citing recent sizable allocations to bitcoin and ether made by major corporate players Binance and MicroStrategy (MSTR). MicroStrategy disclosed Wednesday in an SEC filing that it purchased a little over a thousand bitcoins, raising its total BTC stash to roughly $3.9 billion, according to current market prices.\"It makes me wonder whether new entrants are really entering the market and from a price perspective if this rally is sustainable or organic buying has died down,\" Newhouse added.But since the beginning of February, bitcoin\\'s 50-day average has risen above the 200-day moving average, a so-called \"golden cross\" pattern that suggests to chart users that market sentiment has flipped from bearish to bullish.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated Quotes'],\n",

       "  'The March jobs report to be released Friday is set to show another slowdown in the U.S. labor market, though hiring will likely remain robust even as the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates in a bid to slow the economy.Wall Street economists expect nonfarm payrolls grew by 239,000 last month with the unemployment rate set to hold steady at 3.6%, according to data from Bloomberg.In February, the economy added 311,000 new jobs while the unemployment rate rose to 3.6% amid an uptick in participation. Friday\\'s jobs report will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Financial markets in the U.S. will be closed on Friday, however, for Good Friday.Investors will also closely watch wage growth, with average hourly earnings expected to rise 0.3% over the month and 4.3% over last year. In February, wages rose 0.2% over the prior month and 4.4% over the same month last year.February\\'s jobs report served as a firm-enough signal for the Fed to proceed with a planned interest rate hike on March 22. Those figures dropped just hours before Silicon Valley Bank was seized by regulators, however, with Signature Bank also closed by regulators two days later on Sunday, March 10.Notable impacts from the bank crisis, however, aren\\'t expected to feature in Friday\\'s report.\"The March report comes too early to capture much impact from the recent banking sector woes, with the troubles at SVB not coming to a head until near the end of the survey period,\" wrote Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note last week.Instead, most on Wall Street will be looking toward whether this report argues for another 0.25% rate increase from the Fed next month. Data from the CME Group as of Thursday afternoon showed markets pricing in a 50-50 chance the Fed either elects to hold rates at current levels or increase the target range for its benchmark rate by another 0.25%.Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, expects nonfarm payrolls grew by 250,000 last month and wrote in a note to clients on Thursday this number would be \"too high for the Fed.\"\"FOMC members continue to worry that such rapid job growth will push the unemployment rate to new lows and/or prevent wage inflation from slowing to a pace consistent with the inflation target,\" Shepherdson added.In a press conference last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell called the labor market \"very tight\" as average monthly job gains in the six months through February stood at 343,000.Friday\\'s report does come, however, after data on initial jobless claims on Thursday and private payroll data from ADP out Wednesday suggested the labor market is cooling.Initial claims are seen as the best real-time indicator of stress in the labor market; this measure has shown some signs of increasing in the last few months, with claims totaling 228,000 last week. ADP\\'s report out Wednesday morning showed there were 145,000 jobs added to the private sector last month, below expectations.\"Our March payroll data is one of several signals that the economy is slowing,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP in a press release. \"Employers are pulling back from a year of strong hiring and pay growth, after a three-month plateau, is inching down.\"Earlier this week, job openings data for February also showed open roles in the economy continue to fall, another potential signal the labor market is slowing. February marked the first time since June 2021 there were fewer than 10 million jobs open as of the end of the month.Still, some economists were quick to note that while job openings are on the decline, overall hiring demand remains well above pre-pandemic levels.\"Openings remain noticeably above the highs of prior cycles,\" wrote Wells Fargo economists in a note to clients following Tuesday\\'s JOLTS report.\"At the same time, and despite the steady drumbeat of layoff announcements in recent months, businesses still seem fairly keen to hold onto workers. The layoff and discharge rate dipped back to 1% in February, compared to an average of 1.2% over 2018-2019.\"Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated Quotes'],\n",

       "  'U.S. stocks marched upward Thursday, with tech stocks leading the Nasdaq higher than other indexes, after fresh data pointed to a gradual softening of labor market conditions ahead of the highly anticipated Friday jobs report.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered just above the flatline. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.8%.The stock and bond markets will both close for Good Friday on April 7.Government bond yields were higher. The yield on the 10-year note was up slightly, while rate-sensitive two-year note yields climbed to 3.82% Thursday.On the commodities front, gold futures (GC=F) are shining right now after the metal managed to break the $2,000-per-ounce barrier on the back of weak U.S. economic data, as well as hopes that the Fed will raise rates more slowly.Crude oil (CL=F) continues to hover around $80 a barrel, little changed after big gains to start the week. At the same time, gas prices nationwide have notched up to a five-month high, surpassing $3.50 per gallon, according to data from AAA. The jump comes as the OPEC+ coalition, in a surprise decision last weekend, decided to cut oil production.Meanwhile, applications for U.S. unemployment benefits rose by 228,000 for the week ended April 1, the Labor Department data reported, higher than consensus estimates of 200,000. The prior week was revised up to 246,000 given the government\\'s updated seasonal factors. Continuing claims were also revised up for the week ending March 18 from 1.689 million to 1.823 million.This comes after a report Wednesday from the private payroll firm ADP showed that employers added 145,000 jobs in March as the labor market showed signs of slowing from its strong pace so far this year.That figure was well below the consensus estimates of 210,000 and lower than the revised 261,000 jobs gained in February. But market strategists say it\\'s unclear if ADP’s results foreshadow a softer nonfarm payrolls report Friday, where Wall Street\\'s attention now turns.Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect Friday\\'s jobs report to show 240,000 jobs created last month. This would be significantly lower than the average job gains of 343,000 over the last six months.In additional jobs data earlier this week, the government\\'s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) found that openings receded more than expected to 9.931 million, marking the first time the number dropped below 10 million since May 2021.The gradual slowing in the labor market may be encouraging for policymakers. Some investors are maintaining “a fairly dovish path” from the Fed over the coming months.“For instance, at the next meeting in May, the chances of a rate hike according to futures remained at 47%, after having been as high as 70% earlier in the week,” Jim Reid and colleagues at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to clients.Meanwhile, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Wednesday she predicts rates will need to move higher.\"Precisely how much higher the federal funds rate will need to go from here and for how long policy will need to remain restrictive will depend on how much inflation and inflation expectations are moving down,\" Mester said in a speech at the Money Marketeers of New York University.Markets on Thursday seemed to welcome the comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, who cooled fears that the recent bank failures will send the economy into a recession. Separately, the International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Thursday that the global economy will grow less 3% this year, the lowest medium-term growth forecast since 1990.In single-stock moves:Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) shares slid after the retailer reported softer-than-expected March sales amid a slowdown in discretionary spending from consumers.Shares of Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) moved upward after the company expanded its cloud computing partnership with Microsoft to government agencies.CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) shares rose Thursday following an investor day on Tuesday during which hinted at coming up short on medium-term growth and profit outlook.Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) surged after Delaware\\'s Court of Chancery ruled against a share conversion settlement.Constellation Brands (STZ) shares gained after the company reported results that beat analyst expectations and increased its quarterly dividend.Shares of Levi\\'s (LEVI) plunged 16% after the retailer reported a drop in quarterly profit. The company maintained full-year guidance.Airbnb (ABNB) shares were on the downswing Thursday after a publication reported that top professional hosts are building out their own booking platforms and offering discounts to cut out Airbnb.Shares of Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) and (GOOGL) rose as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai remains bullish that Google\\'s search engine can hold its ground against a ChatGPT-led AI onslaught.

       "  'The IRS lays out where the first chunk of its new $80 billion in funding will go',\n",
       "  '2023-04-07',\n",
       "  'The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) plans to hire nearly 20,000 new employees by the end of the next fiscal year and get rid its outdated paper processes as it spends $80 billion over the coming decade in funds from the Inflation Reduction Act, the agency said in a new report on Thursday.The 150-page \"Inflation Reduction Act Strategic Operating Plan\" provides new insight on exactly how the IRS plans to spend the money that was signed into law last year and details 190 key projects it will undertake in the years ahead.The infusion will allow the agency to reverse at least a decade of underfunding, offer a less frustrating taxpayer experience, and also go after higher-income tax cheats, officials say. The last promise is one that Republicans and other critics of the agency are sure to monitor closely.“We are already making progress in a number of areas and more is on the way,” said IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel, who was recently sworn in. He noted how the IRS has already debuted a new online tool to respond to common notices and hired 5,000 call center workers for this tax-filing season.Other efforts coming in the years ahead include making it possible to file all documents online, adding new enforcement aimed at America\\'s top corporations, new web tools, and more.Well before the release, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had laid out twin goals for the influx of money: improving customer service and launching new efforts to ensure that large corporations and the wealthy pay more of the taxes they owe.On the first front, $6.77 billion is set to be spent on taxpayer services, operations support, and business modernization in coming years. The agency has become known recently for its reliance on paper and outdated technology which has led to massive headaches for taxpayers, punctuated by the backlogs that delayed refunds.“This was an acute issue during the pandemic and we\\'re committed to changing the technology to ensure it doesn\\'t happen again,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said Thursday.The report also says the IRS will develop technology in the years ahead to help taxpayers identify potential mistakes before they file to speed refunds and maximize the deductions people are eligible for.“For many, letters from the IRS in the mail could be a thing of the past,” Werfel said Thursday to underline the technological transformation he hopes to oversee in the years ahead.The agency also plans to add more people. The new employees will come after a decade where a lack of funding under successive administrations has led the agency to dwindle from 95,370 employees in 2010 to just about 80,000 last year.The IRS is aiming to hire over 10,000 new employees devoted to things like taxpayer services, operations support, and business modernization in coming years. That\\'s in addition to over 7,000 devoted to increased enforcement that are set to be on the job by November 2024“We\\'re going to hire more customer service agents and data scientists than anyone ever expected the IRS to do,” Adeyemo said.The hope is that increased computing power and technical expertise will allow the agency to more efficiently serve customers, while also chasing down tax cheats, the second big goal for the IRS.The Biden administration estimates that the top 1% of Americans evade $160 billion in taxes per year because of a lack of enforcement muscle from Washington.The IRS will devote almost $1.8 billion to enforcement in coming years with those efforts growing over time and costing over $45 billion over the full decade. Those plans come amid deep GOP suspicion of the Biden administration and how it will implement the new enforcement money.“I’m skeptical,” Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID) said during Werfel’s confirmation hearing in February over the guardrails to be set in place to ensure audits are directed on only on the rich.Biden officials again promised Thursday that GOP fears were unfounded and that the influx of money won\\'t lead to higher audit rates for small businesses and households making under $400,000.“It makes sense to focus our initial Inflation Reduction Act implementation efforts exclusively on increasing our capacity to assess compliance of high-income and high-wealth individuals, complex partnerships, and large corporations,” said Werfel.He added that this effort on the richest Americans will likely consume his agency for years to come as they untangle complex audits that often take agents up to 50 times longer to complete than the simpler returns among those with lower incomes.Republicans have shot back that the sheer complexity of these returns from high-income individuals will tempt agents to focus on \"lower-hanging fruit\" in lower tax brackets.Still, Democratic lawmakers and outside analysts promise a hefty return on investment, previously saying that the $80 billion will return over $200 billion to the Treasury in increased tax revenue.Officials Thursday declined to outline how much savings they are now predicting, but Werfel said some of the return on investment will be quick.He said the hiring of new compliance officials is already happening and “once that employee is in a seat and trained in doing their work, that return is immediate.”Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the IRS is planning to hire nearly 20,000 new employees by the end of the next fiscal year, not nearly 30,000 as previously reported. Within those new hires, the agency is set to devote over 10,000 of the new employees to things like taxpayer services, operations support, and business modernization and over 7,000 earmarked for enforcement roles, not 19,000 and 9,000 jobs as previously reported, respectively.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube'],\n",

       "  'Mortgage rates fall again, but other obstacles remain for homebuyers',\n",
       "  '2023-04-06',\n",
       "  'Mortgage rates dropped for the fourth straight week, relieving homebuyers a bit more. But bigger declines may be needed to offset other challenges buyers face this spring season.The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage dipped to 6.28% from 6.32% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. Rates have slid nearly a half-point in the last month, reflecting the decline in the 10-year Treasury yield since early March — which was first kicked off by the banking crisis and then sustained by signs that inflation may be cooling.While the drop takes some pressure off of buyers, the persistent lack of for-sale inventory hampers their ability to snag a home. Rates haven\\'t fallen enough either to convince many owners to list their homes, maintaining a housing gridlock that keeps prices elevated.\"Affordability and availability of homes are the biggest hurdles for buyers in today\\'s market, though both are driven by mortgage rates,\" Jeff Tucker, a Zillow senior economist, told Yahoo Finance. \"Many homeowners just are not willing to give up their current house and low monthly payments to jump into a tight, expensive market.”Despite the lower rates, buyers aren’t buying — or can’t buy.The volume of mortgage applications for a home purchase decreased by 4% on a seasonally adjusted basis from one week earlier, according to data for the week ending March 31 from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). Activity remains 35% lower than a year ago on an unseasonal basis.Purchase applications for loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Affairs — popular among first-time buyers — also decreased last week.\"It\\'s buyers at the fringes of affordability that are affected the most,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president of mortgage website HSH.com, told Yahoo Finance. “A borrower may be able to qualify for enough mortgage to participate in her local market when rates are 4.5% or even 5%, but will likely be shut out of it at 6%.”That’s where rates nearly sit now, even though they’re lower than a month ago. The other big obstacle for buyers is the stubbornly low number of homes for sale, which helps to bolster prices.\"Spring has arrived, but the housing market is missing the customary burst in listings and purchase activity that typically mark the season,\" Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s chief economist, said in a statement.For instance, unsold inventory in March was at a 2.6-month supply, according to data released by the National Association of Realtors. A healthy market — where neither buyers nor sellers have the upper hand — typically has a 6-month supply.Additionally, only 410,000 single family homes came on the market this week, down almost 1% from the prior week, according to Altos Research.A big part of the inventory problem is that homeowners who would normally sell are holding off because of rates. According to Redfin, 85% of homeowners had a rate below 6% as of September 2022.\"Just as buyers buy for a reason, sellers also sell for a reason,” Gumbinger said. “Certainly, a homeowner would likely be less willing to give up a record-low rate for a mortgage if they are making a lateral move or moving up, so this may give folks some pause.”Those sellers who have kept their house on the market are getting more reluctant to offer discounts as rates fall and inventory remains scarce, another frustration for buyers. For instance, recent Redfin data shows that the median asking price has been rising steadily since January.“We’re back to getting multiple offers, no concessions from sellers, and buyers back to bidding,” Adriana Perezchica, president of Via Real Estate Group, previously told Yahoo Finance. “When competition picks up, sellers notice and aren’t willing to negotiate.”Rebecca is a reporter for Yahoo Finance and previously worked as an investment tax certified public accountant (CPA).Click here for the latest personal finance news to help you with investing, paying off debt, buying a home, retirement, and moreRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance'],\n",

       "  'International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Thursday that global growth will expand less than 3% this year, ahead of the IMF/World Bank meetings next week.“With rising geopolitical tensions and still-high inflation, a robust recovery remains elusive,” Georgieva said in a speech in Washington.The IMF projects global growth to remain around 3% over the next five years –– the lowest medium-term growth forecast since 1990 and well below the average of 3.8% from the past two decades.The IMF will release more details about its growth outlook when it releases its latest World Economic Outlook next week. An outlook of less than 3% growth this year would be in line with January’s estimate of 2.9% — which was 0.2% higher than previously forecast in October.Georgieva said for 2023, emerging economies are the bright spot—with India and China expected to account for half of global growth. The IMF sees economies in the US and Europe slowing, where higher interest rates weigh on demand. About 90% of advanced economies are projected to see a decline in their growth rate this year, Georgieva said.The managing director also weighed in on navigating inflation in the midst of global banking issues following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank in the U.S. and collapse of Credit Suisse, which led to a hastily arranged takeover by UBS. Georgieva said as long as financial pressures are contained, central banks should “stay the course,” implying continued rate hikes, to bring down inflation.But at the same time, she said central banks \"should address financial stability risks when they emerge through appropriate provision of liquidity. The key is to carefully monitor risks in banks and non-bank financial institutions, as well as weaknesses in sectors such as commercial real estate.\"She added: \"Concerns remain about vulnerabilities that may be hidden, not just at banks but also non-banks—now is not the time for complacency.\"Georgieva said bank failures amid higher interest rates and low liquidity exposed risk management failures at specific banks, as well as supervisory lapses.Georgieva also called for international cooperation to boost global trade, noting IMF research that shows that the long-term cost of trade fragmentation could be as high as 7% of global GDP—roughly equivalent to the combined annual output of Germany and Japan.“If technological decoupling is added, some countries could see losses of up to 12% of GDP,” she said. “And the fragmentation of capital flows, including foreign direct investment, would be another hit to the prospects for global growth.”Click here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisionsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance'],\n",

The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dipped 1.07%.Treasury yields moved down sharply. The yield on the 10-year note slid to 3.303%. The move came after a weak ADP payrolls report on private-sector job growth.Meanwhile, on the commodities front, gold futures (GC=F) are hovering at their highest level in more than a year — and nearing a record high — amid the signs of softening in the labor market. Crude oil (CL=F), which jumped on Monday, fell to hover around $80 a barrel.The S&P 500 closed down 0.6% on Tuesday after new data showed fresh signs of the labor market cooling. The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that US employers reported 9.93 million job openings in the month of February, down from over 10.5 million in January and significantly weaker than the consensus forecast of 10.5 million.“Since 2000 when JOLTS data [started], prior rollovers and drawdowns of similar magnitude in the number of job openings were associated with recessions,” Paul Hickey, cofounder of Bespoke Investments, wrote in a note.On Wednesday, two new data releases pointed to further economic weakness. Private companies added 145,000 jobs in March, lower than consensus estimates of 210,000, signaling that employers are pulling back, payroll processing firm ADP reported.“Our March payroll data is one of several signals that the economy is slowing,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. “Employers are pulling back from a year of strong hiring and pay growth, after a three-month plateau, is inching down.”Meanwhile, growth at US service providers decelerated in March. The Institute for Supply Management\\'s services activity index fell to 51.2, lower than the consensus estimates of 54.4.

       "  'Western Alliance (WAL) stock fell on Wednesday, but pared some losses in afternoon trade, as the Phoenix-based lender released a second preview of first-quarter results to satisfy investors who wanted more clarity on deposit outflows.Western Alliance began the day down as much as 17% after putting out a release late Tuesday showing that its percentage of deposits covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was 68% at the end of the first quarter, \"significantly higher\" than at the end of 2022.In a second update Wednesday afternoon the bank said deposits fell by $6 billion during the first quarter.The stock was down closer to 10% near 2:20 p.m. ET following this second update for investors.The market reaction highlighted the challenges facing regional banks as they prepare to release earnings reports following a month of chaos for the industry. Some banks, such as Los Angeles-based PacWest (PACW) and San Francisco-based First Republic (FRC), have put out certain information early in an attempt to demonstrate stability, but such efforts are not always rewarded by nervous investors looking for new signs of stress.The message was clear: Western Alliance now is less dependent on funding from uninsured depositors who are considered a greater flight risk during periods of uncertainty.Analysts and stockholders focused instead on what Western Alliance didn\\'t disclose, which was exactly how many deposits left the bank during the panic triggered by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early March.Western Alliance said it did experience outflows during that critical period last month but that balances have stabilized, growing by $900 million from March 20 to the end of the month.From the end of the quarter through April 4, another $1.2 billion in deposits were added.Wedbush analysts said in a new note Wednesday published before the company\\'s second update that they forecast deposits dropped 13%-17% in the first quarter, or $7 billion-$9 billion, a larger outflow than the $5 billion Wedbush previously estimated.Western Alliance was one of many regional banks that came under intense scrutiny following the seizures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank on March 10 and March 12, the second- and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history. Western Alliance was the nation\\'s 40th-largest bank at the end of 2022 with nearly $68 billion in assets. Shares of the bank have been roughly cut in half since the start of the year.Small and mid-sized banks across the U.S. lost $196 billion in deposits during the week ending March 15, according to updated data released by the Federal Reserve last Friday.Outflows stabilized the following week as regulators promised to protect all depositors and help regional banks access liquidity if needed. The 25 biggest banks, though, lost $90 billion in the week ending March 22.Western Alliance offered up other points in its release Tuesday designed to calm investors.The bank said it no longer had any borrowings outstanding from the Fed\\'s discount window at the end of the first quarter, and unrealized losses on its bond portfolios had improved \"primarily due to lower interest rates.\"The value of long-term bonds held by many banks fell over the past year due to the Fed\\'s aggressive campaign to bring down inflation by hiking rates.The bank also said its \"immediately available liquidity\" exceeded uninsured deposits. A lack of liquidity in part sank Silicon Valley Bank after its depositors pulled $42 billion in a single day.\"Western Alliance\\'s uniquely flexible, diversified business model positioned us to weather the liquidity tightness that enveloped the industry over the past month,\" said Western Alliance CEO Kenneth Vecchione.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated Quotes'],\n",

The precious metal futures are hovering around $2,038 an ounce on Wednesday, 2.5% away from former highs of $2,089.20 reached in August 2020.Investors have been piling into gold, in anticipation of a Fed pivot as the US economy slows. A weaker dollar and a drop in the 10-year treasury yield are also signs of an expected ease in monetary policy which is helping buoy gold prices.\"Yields are starting to look toward the Fed to pivot, and it looks like gold\\'s just ready to break out. I think these boomer rocks, they\\'re set up for a boom,\" Mike McGlone, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Macro Strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live.Gold enthusiasts have been predicting a break-out for some time.“The key thing that has pressured gold the past 10 years or so has been the U.S. stock market outperforming the world,” said McGlone. \"The key trigger will be when the U.S. stock market continues to underperform the rest of the world, and gold will be the shining star.\"The recent banking crisis helped accelerate a move into the precious metal, as the Federal Reserve initiated moves to shore up confidence in banks.“When things get scary out there, investors run to safe havens, and gold is basically one of those major safe havens,” Gareth Soloway, chief market strategist at Inthemoneystocks.com and verifiedinvesting.com, recently told Yahoo Finance.Soloway is targeting $2,100 for 2023, and a meteoric rise from there.“By 2024, I would actually say we’ll get well above $3,000, maybe $3,500,” said Soloway. “That’s going to be the monster up year.”Ines is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

       "  'U.S. stocks were mostly down, with tech stocks sinking more markedly, after another hiring report showed a slowdown in private-sector job growth and a separate print showed growth at U.S. service providers also experienced a pullback.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved down 0.25%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added a modest 0.24%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dipped 1.07%.Treasury yields moved down sharply. The yield on the 10-year note slid to 3.303%. The move came after a weak ADP payrolls report on private-sector job growth.Meanwhile, on the commodities front, gold futures (GC=F) are hovering at their highest level in more than a year — and nearing a record high — amid the signs of softening in the labor market. Crude oil (CL=F), which jumped on Monday, fell to hover around $80 a barrel.The S&P 500 closed down 0.6% on Tuesday after new data showed fresh signs of the labor market cooling. The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that US employers reported 9.93 million job openings in the month of February, down from over 10.5 million in January and significantly weaker than the consensus forecast of 10.5 million.“Since 2000 when JOLTS data [started], prior rollovers and drawdowns of similar magnitude in the number of job openings were associated with recessions,” Paul Hickey, cofounder of Bespoke Investments, wrote in a note.On Wednesday, two new data releases pointed to further economic weakness. Private companies added 145,000 jobs in March, lower than consensus estimates of 210,000, signaling that employers are pulling back, payroll processing firm ADP reported.“Our March payroll data is one of several signals that the economy is slowing,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. “Employers are pulling back from a year of strong hiring and pay growth, after a three-month plateau, is inching down.”Meanwhile, growth at US service providers decelerated in March. The Institute for Supply Management\\'s services activity index fell to 51.2, lower than the consensus estimates of 54.4. New orders dropped from 62.6 to 52.2 in March, while prices receded from 65.6 to 59.5. Additionally, employment continues to expand but slipped to 51.3 for the month.

The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC)\\xa0slid 0.5%.Oil prices steadied, with WTI crude oil — the U.S. benchmark — wavering around $80 a barrel. After big gains Monday, oil was back in its four-month trading range after OPEC+ announced it would slash output by 1.16 million barrels per day.On the economic front, vacancies at U.S. employers fell to 9.93 million from 10.5 million, a bigger fall than expected. On the other hand, quits were up and layoffs were down, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. Separately, factory orders fell 0.3%, also lower than anticipated.Some economists view the slowdown in the number of open job positions as \"progress\" to reaching the Fed\\'s goal of an equilibrium between supply and demand in the labor market.\"While the Fed will welcome the softening in the data, officials will put much more stock in Friday\\'s employment report and will continue to raise rates at the coming meetings to ensure further progress is made toward softer labor market conditions and lower inflation,\" Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.As Martin noted, another data print on which Wall Street will be keeping a close eye is Friday\\'s jobs report. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the report to show 240,000 jobs created last month. This would be lower than the average job gains of 343,000 over the last six months.Bond yields moved downward after the data prints. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note dipped to 3.35% Tuesday.Tuesday\\'s moves came after the Dow rose and the S&P 500 closed up 0.4% on Monday but the Nasdaq 100 lagged, falling 0.3%. Bond yields were down as manufacturing activity slumped to the lowest level since May 2020, signaling further declines could be coming as credit conditions tighten.Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Monday that the continued strength in the labor market gives the Fed room to fight inflation. Bullard also commented on OPEC’s decision to cut output, suggesting it could potentially make the Fed’s job of lowering inflation more challenging as oil prices increase.Separately, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook also highlighted the continued tightness in the labor market.\"We are still going to see inflation from that, but we’ve seen wage gains moderating quite a bit,\" she said.Still, the Federal Reserve has stuck with inflation as its top concern, even amid the recent banking turmoil that has shown signs of easing.“The Fed rate expected for the next meeting was largely flat against this backdrop, climbing a modest 1.6 basis points to 4.973% with a 63% chance priced in for a 25 basis-point hike next month,” Jim Reid and colleagues at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to clients.However, the recent banking troubles triggered by the failures at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank are “not over yet,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday.In his closely watched annual letter to shareholders, Dimon outlined the damages of financial system turmoil on all banks and urged lawmakers to not “overreact” with more regulation.Elsewhere, Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann apologized for the bank’s failure to save the institution as the firm had been draining deposits for months.Meanwhile, under the current backdrop, the rally in equities will likely waver given the recent bank failures. The oil surprise and a slowdown in growth could send stocks back to their low levels seen in 2022, said JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic.In single-stock moves, shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) plunged Tuesday after a settlement would allow AMC to convert APE preferred shares into common AMC stock.And Disney’s feud with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis escalated. CEO Bob Iger called the governor’s retaliation “anti-business” and “anti-Florida.” Shares of Disney (DIS) ticked down Tuesday.Shares of Virgin Orbit Holdings, Inc. (VORB) sank after the company filed for bankruptcy late Monday after laying off about 85% of its staff in March.C3.ai, Inc.

       "  '2023-04-04',\n",
       "  'Job openings fell in February to the lowest in nearly two years as the labor market trends towards the \"better balance\" Federal Reserve officials, including chair Jerome Powell, have been seeking.The latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, released Tuesday showed there were 9.9 million jobs open at the end of the month, down from 10.6 million in January and 11.6 million in the same month last year.Job openings peaked at over 12 million in March 2022; since that peak, the U.S. economy has added 10.25 million new jobs.This slowdown in the number of open positions also suggests the labor market is trending toward an equilibrium between supply and demand the Fed has seen as pushing wages and inflation higher in recent years.\"The labor force participation rate has edged up in recent months, and wage growth has shown some signs of easing,\" Powell said in a press conference last month.\"However, with job vacancies still very high, labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices.\"The Fed has raised rates from a range of 0%-0.25% at the beginning of 2022 to a target range of 4.75%-5% today, the highest level since 2007.Progress on bringing down the number of open roles in the economy, however, is in the eyes of some economists just that: progress.\"While the Fed will welcome the softening in the data, officials will put much more stock in Friday\\'s employment report and will continue to raise rates at the coming meetings to ensure further progress is made toward softer labor market conditions and lower inflation,\" Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.Economists expect Friday\\'s jobs report will show 240,000 jobs created last month, according to data from Bloomberg. Over the last six months, job gains have averaged 343,000 per month.This decline in open roles also comes as some private sector reports suggest a chunk of open roles are for jobs that don\\'t exist in practice. Last month, The Wall Street Journal, citing data from Clarify Capital, reported that a third of hiring managers said open roles stayed up as a signal to existing employees that help was on the way.But the \"softening\" in the labor market that Powell and others hope to achieve by raising interest rates will need to be considerable given the heights the labor market has reached in the years since the pandemic.To bring job openings down to levels that served as records pre-pandemic, for instance, another 3 million open roles would need to be cut from the economy.\"Openings remain noticeably above the highs of prior cycles,\" wrote Wells Fargo economists in a note to clients on Tuesday. \"At the same time, and despite the steady drumbeat of layoff announcements in recent months, businesses still seem fairly keen to hold onto workers. The layoff and discharge rate dipped back to 1% in February, compared to an average of 1.2% over 2018-2019.\"Look at announcements from the tech sector, signals from the bond market, and fears emanating from the banking world, and recession risks seem omnipresent. Survey-based data also suggests a rising disenchantment with the economy from both consumers and businesses.\"Reducing inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening in labor market conditions,\" Powell said. \"Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.\"But the hard data collected by government agencies in the same manner, month after month, shows an economy that continues to be resilient.Click here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisionsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance'],\n",

       "  'Expect to pay more at the pump if oil prices stay at current levels. Crude futures are trading about $5 higher per barrel after OPEC+ announced a surprise cut in production.The average cost of gasoline in the U.S. is currently $3.51 per gallon, according to AAA. “We should expect it to continue ticking higher here in the next month or two, perhaps heading toward that $4 a gallon level there. So in summary, higher prices basically,” Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kypler, told Yahoo Finance Live.“As we know, with prices at the pump—they shoot up like a rocket but float lower like a feather. And so this is going to provide a bump at the pump essentially,” he added.While higher prices are expected, its unlikely they’ll go near the record $5.01 per gallon reached in June of last year.“Gasoline and diesel prices are expected to rise 12 to 15 cents per gallon,” forecasts Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates. “I expect prices to rise to my previous February 20th price forecast of $3.65 as we head into the summer driving season. I don’t expect a repeat of last summer’s price surge to $5 per gallon.”West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) oil was hovering around $80 per barrel on Tuesday, after gaining more than 6% in the prior session.Brent (BZ=F) futures are trading just below $85 per barrel. The OPEC oil cartel’s surprise production cut of 1.157 million barrels per day along with Russia’s 500,000 bpd reduction extended through the rest of the year has prompted Wall Street analysts to lift their end of year target on oil.Goldman Sachs Commodities Research analysts increased Brent forecasts by $5 to $95 per barrel for December 2023, and $100 for December 2024, up from a prior $97 forecast.Capital Economics analysts also raised their price target stating “we have revised up our end-2023 Brent forecast to $90 per barrel ($85 previously).

       "  '2023-04-04',\n",
       "  'JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders that it\\'s unlikely that tighter regulations would have stopped the sudden deposit outflow that sank Silicon Valley Bank, urging caution as federal officials consider how oversight of the industry should change in the wake of the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.\"It is extremely important that we avoid knee-jerk, whack-a-mole or politically motivated responses that often result in achieving the opposite of what people intended,\" he said.Most of the risks now roiling the banking world, he said, were \"hiding in plain sight,\" including the effect that rising interest rates would have on bonds banks hold as investments. The sudden flight of depositors from Silicon Valley Bank, including $42 billion in one day, was \"an unknown risk\" and \"it is unlikely that any recent change in regulatory requirements would have made a difference in what followed.\"The California lender was seized by regulators on March 10, setting off a panic that required a pledge from federal regulators to cover all depositors at Silicon Valley Bank as well as Signature Bank, which was seized on March 12. Small banks across the country lost more than $100 bullion in deposits over the course of one week before the situation stabilized.The CEO’s comments in his 43-page letter released Tuesday come the week after President Biden asked federal banking regulators to tighten some of the rules loosened at the end of last decade for regional banks, forcing institutions the size of the failed Silicon Valley Bank to hold more liquid assets while undergoing more frequent stress tests. The Federal Reserve is reviewing what changes can be made.Dimon spread responsibility for the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, attributing it to a series of \"colliding factors\" ranging from the sharp rise in interest rates to incentives banks have from regulators to hold government securities, which are considered liquid and safe. Stress tests administered by the Fed, he added, \"never incorporated interest rates at higher levels.\"\"This is not to absolve bank management — it’s just to make clear that this wasn’t the finest hour for many players,\" he said.Dimon said \"the current crisis is not yet over\" and \"there will be repercussions from it for years to come.\" But he also said that it is not like what happened in 2008, when mortgages held by financial institutions around the world went bad.\"This current banking crisis involves far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved,\" he said.He noted, however, that the bank failures \"have significantly changed the market’s expectations\" as \"the market\\'s odds of a recession have increased.\"Dimon has played his own part in the chaos of the past month, helping to organize a joint effort by 11 banks to rescue beleaguered San Francisco lender First Republic (FRC) with $30 billion of uninsured deposits. The infusion followed a steep drop in the shares of First Republic, which was the nation\\'s 14th-largest bank as of Dec. 31 with $212 billion in assets.That placed Dimon at the center of a national banking crisis for the second time in 15 years.In 2008, he acted twice to help stabilize the financial system when JPMorgan Chase purchased New York investment bank Bear Stearns in March of that year, getting a $29 billion backstop from the federal government, and then Seattle’s Washington Mutual in September of 2008. In the case of Washington Mutual, JPMorgan Chase purchased its operations after regulators seized the Seattle thrift. It still is the nation’s largest-ever bank failure.The two deals turned JPMorgan Chase into the nation’s biggest coast-to-coast bank and provided it with an even more powerful hand on Wall Street. They also saddled it with years of legal and regulatory headaches. Dimon has said if he could do it over again he would not have purchased Bear Stearns for those reasons.In his letter Tuesday, Dimon argued that regional, midsize and community banks need to be strengthened and that giant banks should also continue to play a critical role. He repeatedly asked that regulators carefully consider their reaction to the current situation.\"It should be noted that regulations, the supervisory regime and the resolution regime currently in place did not stop SVB and Signature Bank from failing — and from causing systemwide issues,” he said. \"We should not aim for a regulatory regime that eliminates all failure but one that reduces the chance of failure and the odds of contagion. We should carefully study why this particular situation happened but not overreact.\"Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated Quotes'],\n",

Bond yields were down as manufacturing activity slumped to the lowest level since May 2020, signaling further declines could be coming as credit conditions tighten.Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Monday that the continued strength in the labor market gives the Fed room to fight inflation. Bullard also commented on OPEC’s decision to cut output, suggesting it could potentially make the Fed’s job of lowering inflation more challenging as oil prices increase.Separately, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook also highlighted the continued tightness in the labor market.\"We are still going to see inflation from that, but we’ve seen wage gains moderating quite a bit,\" she said.Still, the Federal Reserve has stuck with inflation as its top concern, even amid the recent banking turmoil that has shown signs of easing.“The Fed rate expected for the next meeting was largely flat against this backdrop, climbing a modest 1.6 basis points to 4.973% with a 63% chance priced in for a 25 basis-point hike next month,” Jim Reid and colleagues at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to clients.However, the recent banking troubles triggered by the failures at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank are “not over yet,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday.In his closely watched annual letter to shareholders, Dimon outlined the damages of financial system turmoil on all banks and urged lawmakers to not “overreact” with more regulation.Elsewhere, Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann apologized for the bank’s failure to save the institution as the firm had been draining deposits for months.Meanwhile, under the current backdrop, the rally in equities will likely waver given the recent bank failures. The oil surprise and a slowdown in growth could send stocks back to their low levels seen in 2022, said JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic.In single-stock moves, shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) plunged Tuesday after a settlement would allow AMC to convert APE preferred shares into common AMC stock.And Disney’s feud with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis escalated. CEO Bob Iger called the governor’s retaliation “anti-business” and “anti-Florida.” Shares of Disney (DIS) ticked down Tuesday.Shares of Virgin Orbit Holdings, Inc. (VORB) sank after the company filed for bankruptcy late Monday after laying off about 85% of its staff in March.C3.ai, Inc. (AI)\\xa0shares fell about 26% Tuesday after Kerrisdale Capital, a firm that holds a short position in AI stock, said it has sent a letter to the software maker\\'s auditor.—Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

       "  'The newly-formed tag team of WWE (WWE) and Endeavor (EDR) stand to win a few matches in the investing ring.In a note to clients on Tuesday, Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Erlich laid out a few opportunities: \"While difficult to quantify exact revenue synergies at this stage, there are several areas of significant potential: (1) upcoming media rights renewals at both companies (WWE\\'s Fox and NBC deals expiring in \\'24 with UFC U.S. rights up for renewal at YE25) as well as the ability to create a new direct-to-consumer offering combining UFC and WWE content; (2) increased sponsorship and licensing opportunities; (3) cross-promotional opportunities (including use of UFC athletes for WWE events); (4) improved event operations at WWE including premium hospitality and improved ticketing capabilities and (5) upside potential from sports betting at WWE which recently sought to receive regulatory approval to legalize betting on match results.\"WWE and Endeavor announced Monday that the two public companies would combine in a deal valuing both companies at more than $21 billion. WWE is being valued at $9.3 billion, a more than 33% premium to the company\\'s market cap on Friday, while UFC owner Endeavor is being valued at $12.1 billion.Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel will run the combined company as CEO while WWE majority owner and Executive Chairman Vince McMahon is assuming the executive chairman role. WWE\\'s Nick Khan will be the president of the wrestling brand alongside UFC president Dana White.\"The strategic rationale for this transaction is crystal clear as this creates a pure-play sports IP ownership entity with exposure to the fastest growing sub-segment of media and entertainment-live sports and, in this case, a sports area that has yet to be fully monetized,\" Reif Erlich added.Endeavor stated that it sees deal synergies in the range of $50 million to $100 million, mostly through back office consolidation. The combined company will trade under the ticker symbol $TKO on the New York Stock Exchange.\"We like the announced transaction to merge UFC with WWE as it creates a separate contained live sport entity that can maximize long-term value and valuation for shareholders and no incremental debt usage is a major positive in terms of transaction structure,\" Jefferies analyst Randy Konik said in a client note.WWE and Endeavor didn\\'t return repeated requests by Yahoo Finance for an interview on the transaction.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance\\'s Executive Editor.

       "  'Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger addressed the company\\'s ongoing battle with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis during the media giant\\'s annual meeting of shareholders on Monday.\"A company has a right to freedom of speech just like individuals do,\" Iger said, adding DeSantis\\' policies are \"anti-business\" and \"anti-Florida\" as the politician looks to strip Disney of its self-governing powers.The fight stems from what has largely been seen as a politically-targeted response over the company\\'s reaction to the so-called \"Don\\'t Say Gay\" law, which forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through third grade. In 2022, then-CEO Bob Chapek denounced it at the company\\'s annual shareholder meeting after initially deciding not to speak publicly on the matter.In response,\\xa0DeSantis signed a bill into law that allows him to take control of the company\\'s long-standing special tax district, formerly known as Reedy Creek.Earlier on Monday, DeSantis asked Florida\\'s inspector general to look into a last minute agreement signed by the previous Reedy Creek board that essentially renders the new oversight committee, appointed by DeSantis, powerless.Iger admitted he doesn\\'t understand why DeSantis is punishing Disney given the mutually beneficial relationship between the company and the state.\"We love the state of Florida. I think that\\'s reflected in not only how much we\\'ve invested over the last 50 years, but also how much that we\\'ve given back in the form of jobs and community service, taxes, [tourism] and all sorts of other responsible business practices,\" he said, revealing Disney plans to invest $17 billion at Walt Disney World over the next 10 years, which will create an estimated 13,000 jobs.\"It\\'s always kind of been a two way street,\" he continued. \"[But] to punish a company exercising its constitutional right seems very wrong to me.\"When asked why Disney feels the need to take on any type of political position, Iger said he has certain responsibilities to the business and its 75,000-plus employees.\"As the CEO of the company, my job is to strive to do what I think is best for our business and that includes to invest in what\\'s best for our cast members or our employees and what would enable both to flourish.\"\"I don\\'t think we should or can weigh in on every issue,\" he continued. \"I also understand there will be gray areas. ...The standard is when we take a position on [private or public] matters, there\\'s a true reason why [and] in almost all cases it has to be because it directly effects our business or our people.\"Iger also addressed what\\'s been described as a \"woke\" agenda from Disney, saying he\\'s \"sensitive\" to that perception and the primary mission of Disney is to entertain: \"[Our stories] should not be agenda-driven.\"In terms of the Disney\\'s media strategy, Iger did not dive into specifics regarding the futures of Hulu or ESPN, but did say the \"core strategy of the company going forward from a media perspective would be and should be streaming.\"As a result, the executive dismissed third-party licensing, saying Disney must maintain its exclusive ownership of content in order to best tackle near-term challenges like profitability.Disney\\'s direct-to-consumer division shed a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022 ended on Oct. 1, after it spent an estimated $33 billion on content last year. On the company\\'s latest earnings call, Iger revealed Disney+ was on track to achieve profitability by the end of fiscal 2024.Overall, the executive said the company is focused on quality over quantity content production and that \"sometimes the more is not necessarily the merrier.\"To that point, Disney will continue to lean on its most successful tentpoles with a live-action \"Moana\" film currently in the early stages of development with both Dwayne Johnson and Auli’i Cravalho set to reprise their respective roles.Disney shares traded relatively flat following the meeting\\'s conclusion.Alexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

       "  'Oil prices surged on Monday, pushing the Dow higher and presenting investors with a new wrinkle to start the second quarter after a first-quarter rally kickstarted markets in 2023.When the closing bell rang on Wall Street on Monday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.37%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was higher by 326 points, or 0.98%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was day\\'s laggard, falling 0.27%.Crude oil prices were higher on Monday after and an unexpected oil supply cut from OPEC+ announced over the weekend shook markets. Oil gained more than 6% on Monday, with WTI crude oil — the U.S. benchmark — trading north of $80 a barrel while the international benchmark price, Brent crude oil, was trading near $85 a barrel.A 4% gain in shares of Chevron (CVX) helped the Blue Chip Dow lead markets to start the week. UnitedHealthcare (UNH) gained nearly 5% to lead the Dow.On Sunday, the OPEC+ oil cartel — which includes OPEC members plus Russia — announced it would cut daily production by more than 1 million barrels of oil beginning in May and running through the end of the year.\"Even though, like OPEC, we expect only subdued demand growth this year, the scale of supply cuts will send the oil market balance into a deficit in 2023, with an even larger deficit in Q4,\" wrote Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients on Monday.Last month, the price of oil dropped to an 18-month low as a glut of supply and fears over the global economy shook the oil market. Additionally, a surge in the dollar as investor concern rose over the banking crisis pressured oil.But as worries over an acute financial crisis worldwide have ebbed, the dollar has eased and WTI rose by nearly $10/barrel over the final two weeks of March.A renewed surge in oil prices also potentially complicates the task ahead for the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates in a bid to lower inflation. Although the Fed\\'s preferred inflation measures strip out the costs of food and gas, a marked rise in so-called \"headline\" inflation — which includes energy prices — could complicate the messaging on a pause in interest rate increases later this year.Data out on Friday showed headline inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index rose 5% over the prior year in February; core PCE showed prices rose 4.6% over last year in February.The more widely followed Consumer Price Index showed headline inflation clocked in at 6% over the prior year in February. The Fed targets 2% inflation.On the economic data front, Monday brought investors two key readings on the U.S. manufacturing sector with data from both S&P Global and Institute for Supply Management showing a contraction in activity during March.Both gauges indicated activity in the manufacturing sector contracted during March, with the ISM\\'s index dropping for the fifth-straight month and reaching a level of 46.3, the lowest since May 2020. Any reading below 50 for this index indicates contraction in the sector; readings above 50 indicate expansion.\"The March ISM Manufacturing report indicates that factory activity weakened through the end of last quarter,\" wrote Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Monday.\"We expect the sector to have its worst year since the global financial crisis — aside from the precipitous fall at the start of the pandemic — as weak demand and tighter credit conditions cause activity to contract.\"Monday\\'s drop in the ISM PMI marked the fifth-straight monthly declined and the fourth month in a row the index pointed to a contraction in manufacturing activity.Elsewhere in markets on Monday, a merger in the entertainment world will draw investor attention after Endeavor (EDR), parent company of UFC, announced a deal to merge with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) to form a new company that will trade under the ticker \"TKO.\"Endeavor will own 51% of the new company, with WWE holding a 49% interest.The new company will have an enterprise value north of $21 billion while the companies recognized 2022 revenues of $2.4 billion with a 10% annual revenue growth rate since 2019, the companies said in a press release.Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel will lead the new company, with Dana White serving as President of UFC and Nick Khan overseeing WWE. WWE founder Vince McMahon will serve as executive chairman of the new company.Shares of WWE, which had gained more than 30% this year through Friday\\'s close amid persistent speculation about a takeover, fell 2.1% on Monday. Endeavor shares lost 5.8% on the session.Tesla (TSLA) shares were also in focus early Monday after the company announced first quarter delivery numbers that set a new record for the electric carmaker as a cut in prices boosted overall demand for Tesla vehicles.The company delivered more than 422,000 cars in the first quarter and made more than 440,000 new vehicles during the first three months of the year.Tesla stock fell 6.1% to start the week.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated Quotes'],\n",

       "  'Wall Street is raising its forecasts on oil prices following a surprise OPEC+ announcement to cut production. The output reduction by some of the world\\'s largest exporters, seen by some market watchers as \\'geopolitical posturing\\', sent West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) crude futures up more than 6%.Goldman Sachs Commodities Research analysts increased Brent forecasts by $5/bbl to $95/bbl (vs. 90 previously) for December 2023, and to $100 (vs. 97) for December 2024.“Today’s surprise cut is consistent with the new OPEC+ doctrine to act preemptively because they can without significant losses in market share,” wrote researchers led by Dean Struyven in a note to investors.Analysts at Capital Economics also raised their price target writing, “We have revised up our end-2023 Brent forecast to $90 per barrel ($85 previously). Nonetheless, this forecast does not rule out bouts of price weakness as advanced economies enter recession between now and then.\"The OPEC+ cuts consist of a voluntary reduction of 1.157 million barrels per day which will take effect in May. Additionally, Russia is extending its reduction of 500,000 barrels per day for the rest of the year.Western sanctions on Moscow amid the Ukraine war have diverted Russian energy exports away from Europe, towards countries like China and India.“While surprising, this cut reflects important economic and likely political considerations,” wrote Struyven at Goldman Sachs.“On the economic side, our models suggest that this cut will likely increase Saudi and OPEC+ oil revenues, on net,” said the analyst.On the political side, the move may be related to recent comments from United States Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, indicating it would be “difficult” to refill the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve this year. Those statements contradict prior indications from the Biden Administration that it wants to refill the reserve when WTI was consistently at around $70.“Aside from the impact on the physical oil market, it is hard not to think that there is some geopolitical posturing embedded in these voluntary cuts. It demonstrates the group’s support for Russia and flies in the face of the Biden administration’s efforts to lower oil prices,” wrote analysts from Capital Economics.Ines is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.There is lot coming at investors over the next four weeks — a jobs report, political intrigue, earnings season.But despite all of these inevitable market-moving events, I think Warren Buffett\\'s annual meeting for Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) shareholders on May 6 will hold more importance than in recent years.And it\\'s the one event I think the market is discounting.Buffettpalooza will be the first time markets will hear from the \\'Oracle of Omaha\\' on the banking crisis while this year\\'s meeting also comes just days after a Federal Reserve meeting.When you have someone sitting on $130 billion in cash, as Buffett is, any word on bank valuations, if Berkshire considered doing deals for troubled regional banks, and government actions to save financial institutions will carry tremendous weight.And it\\'s not just the money aspect here, it\\'s Buffett\\'s knowledge of the banking system that further ups the intrigue.Buffett saved Solomon Brothers in the early 90s after a trading scandal. He gave a lifeline to Goldman Sachs (GS) during the financial crisis. And he is a top shareholder in several financial stocks, including American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and U.S. Bancorp (USB).What Buffett may say on high-profile tech holdings HP (HPQ), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) — where CEO Andy Jassy is increasingly on the hot seat — could come as the tech trade stays in favor beyond the first quarter. Some have even begun musing tech is this year\\'s safety trade, and we\\'re curious on how Buffett sees it.Elsewhere as this quarter kicks off we have an indicted former president, Donald Trump, still running for four more years in the White House. The former president\\'s indictment is \"potentially destabilizing one way or the other\" for markets, The Bulwark\\'s editor-at-large Bill Kristol said on Yahoo Finance Live.This Friday will also see the March jobs report released, notable, of course, from the standpoint of potential impacts from the bank crisis.Speaking of that, earnings season for the banks kicks off mid-April. Conference calls from the likes of JPMorgan (JPM) and Bank of America will offer key snapshots into the state of the financial system amid March\\'s sector hurricane.I would also plan to listen to at least 10 regional bank earnings calls, too.Come May 3, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. It\\'s a coin flip sitting here today on whether interest rates will be lifted another 25 basis points, although large-cap tech stocks trade as if the Fed is poised to pause.As ever, Buffett will have a lot to chew on and appears ready to weigh in a broad array of topics.And Buffett seems intent on emphasizing broad this time around, writing in a message to shareholders, \"Last year, I made a mistake by spending too much time on a few subjects. Consequently we answered far too few questions. I won\\'t go astray this year.\"I am looking forward to attending the Berkshire annual meeting for Yahoo Finance.If you plan to be there in person, drop me a line.Until then, happy trading!EconomyConstruction spending, FebruaryISM Manufacturing PMI, MarchS&P Global Manufacturing PMI, MarchWards auto sales, MarchEarningsNo notable companies set to report earnings.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRelated Quotes'],\n",

Learn MoreYou might be tired of hearing about artificial intelligence (AI) after years\\xa0of buzz surrounding the technology's revolutionary potential. However, it likely has a far reach and the ability to alter and enhance a vast variety of industries, with its participants likely to see substantial gains over the long term.The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT last November stunned the tech world with its ability to produce human-like dialogue and kicked off a race in which countless companies have pivoted to AI development. As a result, market leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA 1.11%) and C3.ai have watched their stocks skyrocket 80% and 100%, respectively, since Jan. 1, almost entirely on the back of the AI boom. Despite different forms of AI being utilized and developed for years, the technology still has a long way to go, as do the industries' stocks. Here's why now is an excellent time to consider investing in artificial intelligence stocks.According to Grand View Research, the AI market was valued at roughly $137 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37.3% through 2030. AI adoption is forecast to be widespread, with industries as diverse as cloud computing, automotive, e-commerce, healthcare, and manufacturing increasing their utilization of the technology.Big-name companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla have all implemented AI in their daily operations. For example, Amazon uses AI in its e-commerce business to recommend products to consumers, track shopping trends, and run intelligent robots in its warehouses. As the biggest investor in OpenAI, Microsoft is using the start-up's software, like ChatGPT, to enhance its cloud service Azure, search engine Bing, and its Office productivity programs. Meanwhile, AI plays a crucial role in Tesla's self-driving cars by gathering real-time data from vehicles' cameras.However, these are not actually the best companies to invest in AI. As the technology is virtually limitless, choosing which AI business to invest in now is like trying to decide what will be the most successful website in the early 2000s. Chances are, the most prominent AI company still has yet to emerge. As a result, the smart move is to invest in the companies producing the chips and hardware necessary to run and develop AI software.Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.37%) are arguably the biggest companies in AI, thanks to their powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). These computing components are essential to run AI workloads.In fact, Nvidia is the primary supplier of GPUs to ChatGPT, with research from TrendForce showing the AI program required about 20,000 units in 2020. That figure is projected to increase to 30,000 GPUs as ChatGPT commercializes.\\xa0The partnership has made artificial intelligence Nvidia's No. 1 business, with its data center revenue rising 41% in fiscal 2022, mainly thanks to the flourishing AI market. Meanwhile, last year, AMD acquired Xilinx, a company producing specialized processors for the automotive, industrial, and artificial intelligence markets. The purchase has proven immensely profitable for AMD, with growth in its embedded segment driven almost entirely by Xilinx in 2022. The business reported a revenue increase of over 1,700% to $4.6 billion. The choice between whether to invest in Nvidia or AMD is dependent on which is currently the better value. Nvidia's staggering share-price rise this year has made it a little too expensive, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio at 59, compared to AMD's 30. Nvidia's recent run-up likely indicates that its near-term growth in AI has already been baked into its stock, at least for the next few years.Moreover, AMD's forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.11, compared to Nvidia's 0.3, also indicates AMD is currently undervalued given its potential earnings. Artificial intelligence will likely play a pivotal role in future technology across multiple industries, making its related stocks worth investing in right now. And AMD is the best value stock to back the booming sector.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

       "  \"Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +3.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 13.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -32.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +34.7%. This estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.98 indicates a change of +32.9% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.5 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.6%. The $29.68 billion and $37.11 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10% and +25%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $6.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.8%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $1.32 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +8.64%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  \"Is NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?\",\n",
       "  '2023-04-14',\n",
       "  'NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 57% over the last three months. Given the company\\'s impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company\\'s financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on NVIDIA\\'s  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder\\'s equity. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders\\' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:20% = US$4.4b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The \\'return\\' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders\\' capital it has, the company made $0.20 in profit.So far, we\\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\\'s profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\\'t have the same features.To begin with, NVIDIA seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company\\'s ROE is similar to the industry average of 18%. This certainly adds some context to NVIDIA\\'s moderate 19% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that NVIDIA\\'s reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 27% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is NVIDIA fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.NVIDIA has a low three-year median payout ratio of 7.1%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 93% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.Additionally, NVIDIA has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 2.4% over the next three years. The fact that the company\\'s ROE is expected to rise to 48% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.In total, we are pretty happy with NVIDIA\\'s performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company\\'s earnings are expected to gain momentum.

       "  'Chicago, IL – April 14, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Rambus RMBS, Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL and Netflix NFLX.Wall Street is a complex and ever-changing entity, influenced by many factors such as the Federal Reserve, economic conditions, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment. While stocks can experience long streaks of price appreciation, corrections are a natural part of the market cycle. As the old saying goes, \"Without pain, how could we know joy?\"A correction through price tends to be a dramatic and sudden drop more times than not. The suddenness and velocity can lead to a domino effect, where falling prices cause more selling in what ultimately becomes a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" of sorts. In early 2022, this phenomenon gave way to a correction through both price and time.Conversely, when the stock market corrects through time, it usually means that the price is relatively stable, but the market experiences a brief period of consolidation or sideways price movement. During this time, investors may become hesitant and uncertain, leading to a dry-up in volume and a sideways price chop. Though a correction through time frustrates investors, it can be an essential building block for higher prices later.Corrections through time are evidence of a more robust market. 2022 was indicative of an equity market that required a large correction or reset. Meanwhile, thus far, the current correction is more a sign of a pause in an uptrend.Market corrections are a normal part of the investing cycle and can often be short-lived. Regardless of whether a correction occurs through time or price, investors need to remain calm and avoid making impulsive, emotional decisions. Below are 3 tips on how to navigate a market correction:Ask yourself, \"What stocks are holding up best?\": Relative strength is the most effective yet simple indicator at an investor\\'s disposal during a correction. Think of a strong relative strength stock as a beach ball being held underwater. You can only hold the ball down for so long before it springboards back to the surface. Semiconductor leader Rambus was a prime example of relative strength in September 2022. In the yellow box on the chart below, notice how RMBS was hitting new highs while the S&P 500 Index was weak and retesting lows. Because 3-4 stocks tend to follow the market direction and RMBS didn\\'t, the action was noteworthy.Follow the Leaders: Leaders, or stocks that have been moving up the most in an uptrend are called leaders for a reason – they lead. Presently, tech, specifically semiconductors, are the leading stocks in the market. Innovative chip maker Nvidia is among the \"cream of the crop\" when it comes to true market leaders.As such, regardless of whether or not you caught this year\\'s breathtaking move in the stock, it bears watching. NVDA is pulling into trendline support and the 21-day moving average for the first time in 2023. If it can hold this zone, the correction may be short-lived. If the stock breaks this zone, the correction likely has longer to go.Other leading stocks to watch for more evidence include mega-cap tech stocks such as Microsoft, Apple and Netflix.Know your timeframe: Before a correction occurs, and before you decide to invest in the stock market, for that matter, you should be acutely aware of what you\\'re willing to risk and your time frame. In this case, there is no right or wrong answer. However, your time frame should lead you to how you handle corrections. For example, a long-term investor should be able to take a 5-10% correction in the S&P 500 Index in stride. On the other hand, swing traders may need to stop themselves out of some positions in that case and readjust their portfolio. Either way, investors should prepare and have a clear-cut strategy ahead of time.Price pullbacks are often thought of in a negative light by investors. However, as we explained above, they are a necessary ingredient for the market and can help lead the way for the next market move higher. To succeed, investors should stay calm, informed, and enter corrections with a clear action plan.Why Haven\\'t You Looked at Zacks\\' Top Stocks?

Learn MoreIt's never a bad idea to start investing in tech stocks as the industry is in a near-constant state of innovation, offering consistent gains over the long term. Tech covers a wide range of industries, with one of the best strategies being to invest in companies that have the most to gain from high-growth markets.\\xa0The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, an advanced chatbot capable of producing human-like speech, kicked off an artificial intelligence (AI) race last November. Countless companies have pivoted their business toward AI, with the market expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37.3% through 2030.\\xa0As the leaders of computing components, Nvidia (NVDA 1.11%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.37%), and Intel (INTC -0.75%) produce the hardware necessary to run and develop AI software, making their stocks immensely compelling buys.\\xa0Here are three top tech stocks to buy right now and excellent ways to invest in the future of AI at three different price points.\\xa0Nvidia shares have skyrocketed this year, climbing 86% year to date. The company has rallied investors thanks to its position as the primary supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for ChatGPT, with the devices critical to run the AI program. According to research from TrendForce, ChatGPT utilized about 20,000 GPUs in 2020, with that figure expected to soon hit 30,000 as the software readies for commercialization. And Nvidia stands to profit significantly from its expansion.\\xa0The tech giant's recent bull run has pleased investors but has also made it more expensive to buy in. Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio has risen 151% since Jan. 1, currently sitting at 156, with the metric making it the most expensive pick on this list. However, it's crucial to keep a long-term perspective. Nvidia's stock may be pricey against its earnings, but it also has the strongest position in AI right now and is coming out of an economically challenging year that hurt it financially. Nvidia remains a top tech stock and will likely offer investors substantial gains in the coming years, thanks to AI.\\xa0Wall Street has also grown bullish over AMD in 2023, with its stock up around 45% since the start of the year. In addition to developing GPUs like Nvidia, the company is leading the way in central processing units (CPUs). Its consumer line of Ryzen CPUs has helped AMD grow into a tech behemoth and given it the resources to branch out into other aspects of tech like data centers and AI.The company's hardware powers data centers worldwide, with its chips servicing cloud giants Microsoft's Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Oracle. The cloud market has become closely aligned with AI development, with Microsoft's $1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019 allowing it to integrate much of the start-up's technologies into Azure and other services.\\xa0As a result, AMD is indirectly profiting from the development of AI through the cloud market while also being a great option for companies needing GPU power.\\xa0With a recent price-to-earnings ratio of 106, AMD shares are a better value than Nvidia but still pricey. However, the same argument as with Nvidia is still valid here. AMD's stock climbed 858% in the last five years and more than 3,600% in the last decade. Alongside the development of AI, AMD is a top tech stock likely to soar over the long term.\\xa0Like the previous two companies, Intel is striving to grow its position in artificial intelligence. As a legacy chipmaker, the company spent years pushing the technology forward, with its AI chips generating about $3.5 billion in revenue in 2019. Steep competition from Nvidia and AMD has led Intel to lose a bit of steam, but it still has a lot to gain from the development of the industry.\\xa0At the start of January, Intel launched its Sapphire Rapids line of CPUs, designed with AI and cloud computing in mind. The chips have been slightly overshadowed by AMD's competing Genoa series, which was released two months before. However, the launch sees Intel making its strongest push into AI and is a promising sign of things to come.\\xa0With a price-to-earnings ratio of 16, Intel is by far the best-value tech stock on this list. Macroeconomic headwinds have hit its business hard in recent years, but the company continues to have a positive long-term outlook, making Intel an attractive tech stock right now.\\xa0Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreIn the 1990s, seemingly any company with a link to the internet saw its share price soar. A similar (although less exuberant) phenomenon appears to be underway now. The difference this time is that the technology in question is artificial intelligence (AI).Several tech giants are especially on a roll. Shares of Amazon (AMZN 0.11%) have jumped nearly 20% so far in 2023. Nvidia (NVDA 1.11%) stands out as one of the biggest winners of all, with a year-to-date gain of over 85%.\\xa0But which of these will be the better AI stock over the long run? Here's how Amazon and Nvidia stack up against each other.Amazon's most visible AI product is its Alexa virtual assistant. As widely used as Alexa is, though, it's not the most significant AI opportunity for Amazon. That distinction belongs to the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit.AWS ranks as the largest cloud services provider in the world, with a market share of 33%, according to technology services company AAG. It's a key growth driver and Amazon's most profitable business. Organizations that want to build AI applications in the cloud already have plenty of tools at their disposal with AWS. AI services offered include building chatbots, speech recognition, text-to-speech, image and video analysis, language translation, and a lot more.\\xa0Amazon is poised for tremendous growth over the next decade and beyond, thanks in large part to AWS' AI opportunity. But AI isn't the only business that could provide a major catalyst for the stock. Other major potential growth drivers for Amazon include connected TV and healthcare.Nvidia rose to success because its graphics processing units (GPUs) were the gold standard for powering gaming apps. Gaming remains a huge moneymaker for the company -- and a significant growth opportunity as well.\\xa0However, Nvidia's future fortunes are linked to AI more than anything else. The same attributes that made the company's GPUs so great for gaming also make them ideal for AI apps.Many of the biggest names in AI have teamed up with Nvidia. Amazon's AWS and Nvidia have been partners for over 10 years and announced a new generative AI collaboration last month. Alphabet\\xa0is integrating Nvidia's GPUs with its Google Cloud Vertex AI platform. Microsoft\\xa0is making Nvidia's DGX Cloud AI supercomputer available to customers on its Azure cloud platform.\\xa0Nvidia doesn't just have powerful chips and hardware, though. It offers a full-blown AI platform including its supercomputer, software, AI models, and services. The company's AI solutions feature data analytics, generative AI, speech AI, self-driving car technology, and more.One of the most intriguing AI innovations from Nvidia is its new cuLitho software library. This AI software helps chipmakers significantly speed up their manufacturing process. In a real sense, AI could help make AI better with cuLitho.Both Amazon and Nvidia should have tremendous growth potential amid the AI boom. However, we haven't discussed two important factors yet: competition and valuation.Amazon's AWS unit faces increasingly tough competition from other cloud services providers, notably including Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. It's possible (and arguably probable) that these two main rivals will gain market share at AWS' expense.Likewise, Nvidia has competition in the AI arena. In particular, AMD is betting big on AI. For now, though, Nvidia appears to have a clear advantage.\\xa0\\xa0Both Amazon and Nvidia stocks trade at lofty earnings multiples. However, Amazon is taking steps to increase its profits, which should lead to stronger earnings growth over the next few years. Meanwhile, some investors are worried that Nvidia's share price has risen too much, too quickly.I like and own both of these stocks. Amazon is one of my favorite stocks to buy right now. My view, though, is that Nvidia is in a better position than Amazon to profit in more ways from the rise of AI. Because of this, I see it as the better AI stock over the long term.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

Learn MoreNvidia (NVDA 1.11%) stock's sharp rally is showing no signs of cooling off. The semiconductor bellwether has rewarded investors handsomely in 2023 with gains of nearly 89% so far, and it looks like the hype around artificial intelligence (AI) could help it sustain its terrific momentum in the stock market.The addressable market for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) could jump substantially thanks to the growing deployment of AI applications, giving the company's fast-growing data center business a big boost.That won't be surprising since OpenAI's popular chatbot ChatGPT, which is a generative AI application, reportedly uses\\xa010,000 Nvidia GPUs. That number is expected to cross\\xa030,000 as OpenAI scales up ChatGPT to meet the growing demand for chatbots.Analyst Dylan Patel of semiconductor research firm SemiAnalysis points out that booming demand for graphics cards for AI applications is creating a shortage of Nvidia's GPUs. CEO Jensen Huang said last month that the company is witnessing\\xa0an acceleration in demand thanks to the popularity of generative AI.So should investors who have missed the Nvidia gravy train so far in 2023 buy the stock now in anticipation of more upside? Let's find out.Market research firm Research Dive forecasts that demand for AI accelerators such as central processing units (CPUs), GPUs, data processing units, and other chips could grow at an annual pace of 39% through 2031, generating a whopping $332 billion in annual revenue at the end of that forecast period. Nvidia is in a solid position to take advantage of this huge opportunity.New Street Research estimates that Nvidia controls\\xa0a whopping 95% of GPUs used for machine learning. The research firm points out that its A100 GPU, which is priced at $10,000, has become the go-to chip for powering AI workloads in data centers and supercomputers. Not surprisingly, OpenAI used\\xa0thousands of A100 GPUs to train ChatGPT, and it is not the only one using Nvidia's chips to power its AI applications.Stability AI, which is known for the Stable Diffusion generative AI platform that can turn text into images, is also a customer for Nvidia's A100 GPUs. Stability AI was using 32 of these GPUs last year, a number that ballooned to 5,400 in February 2023. With the generative AI market expected to clock 21% annual growth over the next decade, increasing from just under $9 billion last year to more than $126 billion in 2033, sales of GPUs meant for AI workloads should boom.This should help Nvidia maintain terrific growth in the data center business. The company's data center revenue has increased from just below $3 billion in 2019 to $15 billion in 2022. The segment produced 55% of Nvidia's total revenue last fiscal year, growing 41% over the prior year. This healthy growth was the reason Nvidia's total revenue remained flat year over year at $27 billion in fiscal 2023 despite steep declines in the gaming and professional visualization businesses.And now, the company is expanding the reach of its AI platform through a cloud-based offering known as DGX Cloud that will allow companies to develop generative AI applications without investing a lot of money in hardware. That puts Nvidia in a position to take advantage of another rapidly growing market. A cloud-based AI GPU service means that companies won't have to spend huge amounts of money on setting up the required infrastructure, which they can simply rent\\xa0from Nvidia.Essentially, Nvidia is providing its GPUs as a service. Global Market Insights estimates that the GPU-as-a-service market could be worth over $80 billion by 2032, up from just $5 billion last year, clocking 30% annual growth through the next decade. So, the data center business will continue to move the needle in a big way for the company and drive growth even as it faces challenges in the personal computer (PC) market.At 155 times trailing earnings, Nvidia is richly valued. The price-to-sales ratio of 25 further tells us how expensive Nvidia stock is right now following its tremendous rally in 2023.But a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 60 highlights a huge improvement in the bottom line. That's not surprising given the impressive pace at which Nvidia's earnings could grow from last fiscal year's figure\\xa0of $3.34 per share.NVDA EPS estimates for current fiscal year data by YCharts.It is worth noting that Nvidia's top-line growth is also expected to accelerate in fiscal 2024 and 2025.NVDA revenue estimates for current fiscal year data by YCharts.It won't be surprising to see Nvidia clock faster growth than Wall Street is looking for thanks to the massive opportunity in AI and data centers. So investors seeking to take advantage of the AI boom -- and who are willing to pay a rich multiple for a dominant player in a multibillion-dollar market that's growing rapidly -- could go long on Nvidia before it becomes more expensive.Investors with a lower appetite for risk could get a chance to buy the stock at a relatively cheaper valuation if the headwinds in the PC market continue to weigh on its growth. However, they shouldn't forget that the data center business is now bigger than gaming, and the rapid growth of the former could be enough to offset the PC weakness and send the stock higher. In simpler words, Nvidia stock's hot rally seems here to stay.Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

       "  '2023-04-13',\n",
       "  'NVIDIA Corporation NVDA launches a gaming chip – GeForce RTX 4070 GPU (graphics processing unit). The newly launched chip is powered by the company’s AI-enabled Ada Lovelace architecture to provide gamers with a whole new experience with more realistic images.NVIDIA revealed that RTX 4070 graphics cards would go on sale from Apr 13 onward at $599. The newly launched chip is believed to be the company’s mid-range GPU, which costs up to $1,599.Additionally, the GeForce RTX 4070 will be the company’s lowest-priced GPU chip, which uses its newest AI technology. NVDA stated that the Ada Lovelace architecture-powered chip would include features such as “DLSS 3 neural rendering, real-time ray-tracing technologies and the ability to run most modern games at over 100 frames per second at 1440p resolution.\"NVIDIA Corporation Price and ConsensusNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteWe believe that NVIDIA’s Ada Lovelace architecture has provided it with a technological edge against its rivals in the graphics card space. Named after a 19th-century mathematician, who many consider the first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace architecture-based chips use AI to improve video game graphics.Ada Lovelace architecture-based GPUs are built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM with its so-called “4N” chip manufacturing technology. NVIDIA revealed that the GPUs come with Micron Technology’s MU GDDR6X memory and are claimed to have improvements across its shader cores, RT cores and Tensor cores.Ada Lovelace-powered graphics cards have the capability of improving existing games immediately, and the enhanced AI feature will learn from the gameplay. NVIDIA claims that the RTX 4070 chip will be 2.6 times faster than the RTX 2070 SUPER and 1.4 times faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 with DLSS 3.NVIDIA claims that the integration of the DLSS 3 feature tremendously boosts the performance of its Ada Lovelace GPUs. In addition to this, the newly launched RTX 4070 GPU “also excels in traditional games that do not include more advanced features such as ray tracing and DLSS,” the company said in a statement.Built on Taiwan Semiconductor’s 4N chip manufacturing technology with Micron’s memory, NVIDIA’s RTX 4070 chip consumes nearly half the power compared with RTX 3080 and provides an additional 2 GB of memory. The RTX 4070 chip is accompanied by 36 MB of L2 cache and 12 GB of ultra-high-speed GDDR6X memory.With its sustained focus on developing new and more advanced products, NVIDIA has always maintained a significant technological gap against its rivals in the graphic card space.Priced at $599, RTX 4070 chips are now NVIDIA’s cheapest available GPU, which uses AI technology. This will help the company drive gaming revenues, which have been negatively impacted by the weakening demand for its chips used in the gaming end market.NVDA’s Gaming revenues plunged 46% year over year to $1.83 billion and accounted for 30.3% of total fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to a lower sell-in of Gaming products. This reflected a reduction in channel partner inventory levels amid weak demand due to macroeconomic headwinds and lockdowns in China, which weighed on consumer demand.We believe that the lower-priced new GPU will help the company drive the demand for its gaming chips.Currently, NVIDIA and Micron each carry Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Taiwan Semiconductor has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of NVDA, MU and TSM have rallied 81.3%, 24% and 16.7%, respectively, year to date.A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Lattice Semiconductor LSCC, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\\'s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lattice’s first-quarter 2023 earnings has been revised upward by a couple of cents to 50 cents per share over the past 60 days ago. For 2023, earnings estimates have been revised northward by 3 cents to $2.10 per share in the past seven days.Lattice\\'s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, the average surprise being 7.1%.

       "  \"What's Up for Chip ETFs After Their Best Quarter Since 2020?\",\n",
       "  '2023-04-13',\n",
       "  'Chip or semiconductor stocks just recorded their best quarter since 2020, per CNBC. VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is up about 24.4% so far this year (as of Apr 6, 2023). Tech stocks, in general, were in favor in the first quarter of 2023 as investors believe that the Fed could slow down or stop rate hikes (on signs of slowing inflation) in the near term. As growth sectors like technology fare better in a falling rate environment, chip stocks won.Moreover, tech stocks also benefited from their safe-haven status amid the banking turmoil in March.\\xa0 U.S. tech stocks hit rough weather last year. But the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the United States, the buying of Credit Suisse by the UBS and the panic-selling in Deutsche Bank led investors to look for a safe haven in the equity space. In this pursuit, tech ETFs have lately emerged as winners.Apple AAPL gained 30%, while NVIDIA NVDA surged more than 90% in Q1. Moreover, the recent hype over artificial intelligence on ChatGpT’s success also favored Nvidia. Now, Nvidia is offering generative AI cloud services and hardware for enterprises (read: Best & Worst Performing ETF Areas of Q1 2023).It all depends on the global growth momentum, inflationary pressure, central banks’ moves and the supply-chain recovery. If inflationary pressure comes down and the central banks act dovish, this would be great news for the tech space (and chip too).However, there are some concerns. The electric car behemoth Tesla (TSLA) recently said that it is using fewer silicon carbide wafers since silicon carbide is an expensive semiconductor. The latest announcement went against the semiconductor space.In fact, this could be a trend in the EV market in the coming days as many EV makers may follow Tesla’s footsteps. However, this is just the beginning. It would take a whole lot of time for the deployment of silicon carbide to be no longer in use.The global economy is slowing. Some big economies may witness recession ahead. Consumers will also start reducing spending, which will result in struggling PC and smartphone demand. Then, enterprises will start to reduce spending in anticipation of a global recession. These are huge headwinds for the chip market.An industry survey for Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components in the United States revealed that new orders have started to ease in March. The supply -chain disruption — particularly in electronics — is still massive compared to the pre-pandemic conditions. The survey for Transportation Equipment also mentioned that “sales are slowing at an increasing rate.” These are alarming signs for the growth of the semiconductor space.Having said all, we would like to note that if the global economy manages a soft landing ahead instead of a recession, things may not prove detrimental for the chip space. This is especially true given the lucrative valuation of the semiconductor ETFs despite the recent rally.SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF XSD, VanEck Semiconductor ETF,iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF FTXL and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ have P/E ratios of 20.85X, 20.35X, 20.34X, 18.91X and 15.08X, respectively.

Learn MoreIntel (INTC -0.75%) has great aspirations for its third-party foundry service (a chip-manufacturing business that makes chips designed by other companies). Intel's plans will bring it into closer competition with what is far and away the world's largest foundry service, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.17%), or TSMC for short.\\xa0That's why it might come as a surprise that Intel is reportedly using TSMC to manufacture its next-gen GPUs (graphics processing units), according to Taiwan's Commercial Times newspaper. If this winds up being true, is this bad news for Intel, and great news for TSMC? The answer is a bit more nuanced. \\xa0Let's address the elephant in the room, TSMC. The company already commands over half of the world's chip foundry market, thanks to its technical abilities as well as its impressive customer service. Once a clear-cut leader emerges in an industry, it's incredibly difficult for competitors to dislodge it. No surprise, then, that TSMC keeps scooping up new business, even from would-be rivals. \\xa0But is earning Intel's business a coup, especially with Intel working so hard to retool its own manufacturing prowess? Not really. After all, TSMC is the manufacturer of Intel's current generation of discrete GPUs (a stand-alone system, versus a graphics processor integrated into a CPU), the Arc Alchemist GPUs for video gaming and professional visualization. \\xa0Intel must be finding it cost effective to continue using TSMC for its consumer-facing GPUs, because its next-gen units (code-named Battlemage, slated for release the second half of 2024, and Celestial, in 2026) will also use TSMC fabs. \\xa0But to call this a big win for TSMC would be a stretch. Intel GPUs are small potatoes (more on that in a moment), so booking new GPU business for a couple of years down the road won't move the needle.It's widely accepted that Apple is TSMC's biggest customer, accounting for over 20% of the foundry's sales. Other top customers include MediaTek, AMD, Qualcomm, and Nvidia, to name a few. Intel likely accounts for a minimal -- one could even argue insignificant -- amount of TSMC's annual revenue. While TSMC getting more Intel business is another feather in its cap, this isn't exactly bad news for Intel. In fact, this could be a good move for the chip company.\\xa0Intel is a late entrant to the discrete GPU space, offering consumers a third choice versus market-leader Nvidia and scrappy AMD. But even though Intel's latest Arc series GPUs have been a solid option (especially with the heavy discounting creating attractive price-to-performance for video gamers), they haven't exactly been a runaway success.\\xa0Intel's Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics business brought in just $837 million in revenue in 2022, or a paltry 1.3% of total sales. And the unit generated an operating loss of $1.7 billion. Yikes! \\xa0So why bother with this cash-bleeding segment at all? Indeed, there were rumors late in 2022 that Intel could axe its floundering consumer GPU business, though this later report out of Taiwan seems to indicate Intel has come too far with its development of the Battlemage and Celestial chips to turn back now. Intel's GPU unit lost lots of cash in 2022 (no doubt partly because of the discounting), but it still expanded revenue 8% year over year. That's in contrast to declines at market leader Nvidia. Intel has said it sees demand in the coming years for an affordable GPU, so as the market for gaming PCs improves, the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics segment could win over customers, and perhaps flip to a profit at some point. \\xa0In the meantime, Intel can keep the bulk of its business (its PC, laptop, and data center processors, as well as its third-party foundry aspirations) focused on executing a turnaround, while the tried-and-true TSMC handles manufacturing of the tiny GPU business.\\xa0I'm not buying Intel stock at this point, especially not because of its bet on video gaming GPUs. For now, I see plenty of other well-established companies generating growth and profitability, with stocks trading at attractive valuations (like TSMC, for example). Nevertheless, keep a close eye on Intel stock in 2023 as the company begins to lay the groundwork for a possible turnaround.Nicholas Rossolillo and his clients have positions in Advanced Micro Devices, Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreThe tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has bounced back strongly in 2023 and shot up close to\\xa019%, driven by rising investor confidence in tech stocks amid signs\\xa0of cooling inflation, a potential pause\\xa0in the Federal Reserve\\'s rate hikes, and the emergence of hot growth avenues such as artificial intelligence.What\\'s more, history suggests that tech stocks could appreciate strongly\\xa0following a down year. For instance, tech stocks jumped 15% in 1988 following a 5% drop the prior year, soared 57% in 1991 after an 18% decline in 1990, and gained 35% in 2019 after 2018\\'s pullback of 4%. These are just some of the instances when tech stocks bounced back impressively after a down year. And 2023 isn\\'t looking any different thus far following last year\\'s\\xa033% crash.So it wouldn\\'t be surprising to see the Nasdaq head higher as the year progresses. This is the reason why investors should consider buying shares of Nvidia (NVDA 1.11%) and Upstart Holdings (UPST -2.35%), as they could double in the next five years. Let\\'s look at the reasons why buying these stocks could be a solid move.There has been a ton of hype around artificial intelligence (AI) applications in recent months, and that explains the 87% rally\\xa0in Nvidia stock in 2023. With Nvidia controlling an estimated 95% of the artificial intelligence (AI) graphics card market, it isn\\'t surprising to see that investors have been piling into this semiconductor stock this year.After all, Nvidia\\'s graphics processing units (GPUs) are the backbone\\xa0of the AI industry, powering popular generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. As it turns out, the deployment of Nvidia\\'s chips for AI applications is 20 to 100 times more than that of rivals\\' offerings. This should set the stage for terrific growth in Nvidia\\'s business over the next five years and beyond, as the global AI chip market is expected\\xa0to generate $263 billion in annual revenue by 2031, a massive increase from $11 billion in 2021.Nvidia\\'s dominant position in this market means that it could corner a nice chunk of that huge opportunity, especially considering that it is expanding its processor lineup beyond GPUs to boost its presence in the AI chip market. When Nvidia\\'s revealed its Grace server processors two years ago, it claimed that they \"will deliver 10x the performance of today\\'s fastest servers on the most complex AI and high-performance computing workloads\" compared to the x86 processors from Intel and AMD.Nvidia deployed the Grace server processors in its AI inference platform last month, and pointed out that they will enter full production in the second half of 2023. With this move, Nvidia is now offering a full stack of AI solutions that includes both hardware and software. The company estimates that the addressable market for its full-stack AI offerings is worth\\xa0a mammoth $300 billion.Moreover, Nvidia sees a total addressable market worth a whopping $1 trillion across multiple industries ranging from gaming to AI to data centers to automotive. The company generated $27 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months, indicating that it is at the beginning of a massive growth curve.Not surprisingly, Nvidia\\'s revenue growth is expected to accelerate. Consensus estimates indicate that Nvidia could generate $29.8 billion in revenue this fiscal year, an increase of 10% over fiscal 2023\\'s revenue of $27 billion. In fiscal 2025, which is the company\\'s next fiscal year, it is expected to deliver 24% revenue growth to $37 billion. That growth rate could accelerate in the following years as AI adoption gains critical mass and the company starts taking advantage of other opportunities.Assuming Nvidia delivers consistent annual revenue growth of 25% for the next five years, its top line could hit $82 billion in fiscal 2028, using fiscal 2023\\'s revenue of $27 billion as the base. Nvidia has a five-year average price-to-sales multiple of 17. It could command a similar multiple after five years as well thanks to its commanding position in the GPU market. Multiplying Nvidia\\'s projected sales after five years with the company\\'s sales multiple translates into a market cap of nearly $1.4 trillion.That\\'s more than double Nvidia\\'s current market cap of around $675 billion, suggesting that it could double investors\\' money in the long run.The past year has been terrible for Upstart investors, as shares of the AI-enabled lending platform crashed\\xa0a massive 82%. That terrible drop has been driven by rising interest rates that led to a sharp pullback in the company\\'s growth.For instance, the company\\'s revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 was down a whopping 52% year over year to $147 million. This sharp decline was a result of a big drop in loan originations by Upstart\\'s lending partners. These lending partners originated $1.5 billion worth of loans during the quarter, a 62% decline over the prior year. Upstart\\'s conversion rate (which refers to the percentage of inquiries converted into actual loans) also fell to 11% from 24% in the prior-year period.The company\\'s full-year 2022 revenue was down\\xa01% to $842 million. Consensus estimates indicate that things are likely to get worse for Upstart this year. Its revenue is expected\\xa0to fall 34% to $553 million. The company is expected to swing to an adjusted loss of $0.88 per share from a profit of $0.21 per share in 2022.But investors would do well to buy Upstart stock while it is still down and is trading at a cheap 1.7 times sales. The stock has gained 28% in 2023 and it could soar higher thanks to a couple of factors.First, inflation fell for the eighth month in a row in February this year. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 6% year over year in February, down significantly from the 9% growth it recorded in June last year. Inflation is expected to fall further as the year progresses and average 4.2% for 2023, down significantly from last year\\'s average of almost 9.6%. What\\'s more, inflation could cool further in 2024, with CPI growth expected to average 3%.Cooling inflation should set the pace for potential interest rate cuts going forward, and increase the demand for loans.The second reason to buy Upstart stock is the massive addressable market the company is targeting. Upstart partners with banks and credit unions and uses AI to provide loans to consumers using non-traditional credit data. Upstart simply acts as a marketplace that connects loan providers with consumers based on the credit data it generates using AI algorithms.The adoption of AI in banking services is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, clocking annual growth of nearly 23% through 2032. As Upstart\\'s AI platform claims to have four times better risk separation than\\xa0the FICO score, it could continue to gain more traction in the future. Additionally, Upstart claims\\xa0that it sees a $780 billion addressable market in auto loans, $644 billion in small business loans, and $162 billion in personal loans.So a combination of a low-interest rate environment, the deployment of AI in banking and lending, and a huge addressable market should help Upstart regain its mojo. Not surprisingly, its top-line growth is expected to gather terrific momentum and increase 41% in 2024. The company is also expected to swing to an adjusted profit of $0.62 per share next year, and is expected to clock 30% annual earnings growth for the next five years.Applying the 30% projected earnings growth to 2024\\'s estimated earnings for four years would translate into earnings of $1.77 per share at the end of 2028. Multiplying the projected earnings after five years with the Nasdaq-100\\'s forward earnings ratio of 25.7 would translate into a share price of $45 after five years. That\\'s easily more than double Upstart\\'s current stock price of almost $17, suggesting that it could turn out to be a solid growth stock in the long run.Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

       "  '2023-04-12',\n",
       "  'As Big Tech\\'s next earnings cycle approaches, the sector is stuck between a rock and a hard place.On one hand, some tech stocks have rallied in recent weeks, as the Street positively responds to cost-cutting efforts at companies like Meta (META). On the other hand, near-term, there\\'s still a sense that tech is a little unsteady, with the industry entrapped in a game of macroeconomic whack-a-mole.\"There are still so many questions as to where the bottom really is,\" said Bernstein Analyst Mark Shmulik. \"When do things start looking good again? I don\\'t think anyone is expecting great numbers this quarter, but they\\'re definitely looking at guidance for next quarter and this year.\"By looking at the markets, you wouldn\\'t even know that tech companies are coming off a historically difficult year for the sector.In 2023 so far, tech stocks have rallied, even sending the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) barreling into a new bull market, Yahoo Finance\\'s Jared Blikre pointed out just a few weeks ago. As of this afternoon, Apple (AAPL) is up about 29% year-to-date and Meta\\'s shot up roughly 73% year-to-date, while chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) — the biggest winner of all — has seen its shares climb approximately 87% in these first months of 2023.“Tech is on pins and needles right now,” said Wells Fargo Analyst Michael Turrin.“The stocks have moved up, but the fundamentals don’t suggest we’re all the way out of the woods yet. Right now, the question is, ‘Have we turned the corner’? Was there more conservatism in guidance to start this year?\\' If so, maybe we can get back to normal ….There’s going to be a lot of careful attention to what management teams say about the macro.”However, market-spanning tech optimism is in some ways more about the Federal Reserve than it is about tech itself – which creates a precarious situation in which hopes could bump into a tougher-than-expected reality.Tech was slammed by rising interest rates in 2022, and there\\'s certainly the idea that we\\'re seeing the light at the end of the rate-hike tunnel. But whether or not we\\'re at the end of the rate cycle, all tech companies are trapped in it right now.Though more mature tech companies, like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), will be less jarred by Fed Chair Jerome Powell\\'s next moves, the sector\\'s priorities and narratives will be dictated by what the Fed does next, said Andrew Boone, analyst at Citizens-owned JMP Securities.\"If Powell starts to pause rates, or if we\\'re one hike away, all those tech stocks start to work,\" he said. \"At the end of the day I feel like we\\'re still in this macro cycle. If Powell continues to tighten, focus will stay on profitability. However, if rate hikes slow and we\\'re at the end of the tightening cycle, tech is just going to rip.\"In recent months, profitability concerns have been center stage for tech. To Boone, one of tech\\'s biggest outstanding questions is how much companies have truly saved from the waves of layoffs they\\'ve been conducting over the last six to eight months. The reduction of headcount costs should materially improve companies\\' bottom lines – the question is just by how much.\"We\\'re actually going to start to see that money that\\'s been saved from these layoffs,\" said Boone. \"We\\'re actually going to see the numbers behind the cost discipline story, and that\\'s going to be one of the drivers of stock performance over the next six weeks.\"As the earnings calls start coming in, there are three additional key areas to keep an eye on – what companies say about the digital advertising and cloud slowdowns, and how they talk about AI, said Bernstein\\'s Shmulik.\"Digital advertising is a big theme, as is cloud,\" he told Yahoo Finance. \"People are comfortable with digital advertising bottoming out, but are less so with cloud. The question for both is: \\'How bad do the numbers get?\\' Digital ad numbers seem to be in a rut but holding, and people expect the entire sector to recover. We\\'re not quite there for cloud, though, because the numbers keep going down.\"This cloud slowdown could be existential for companies that have long relied on cloud growth to bolster their businesses across the board, like Amazon (AMZN).\"There\\'s no safety to point to on Amazon, which is why the stakes are so high,\" Shmulik added.As the AI hype cycle keeps building, Boone, Shmulik, and Turrin think AI talk will feature prominently in earnings calls this season. But for now, a lot of what we\\'ll hear is just that – talk.“Most investors I speak to don’t have conviction that things have really changed a lot,\" said Turrin. \"AI has been really encouraging because it allows us to think about the future. Stocks have moved up on this AI theme, but that’s not likely to right now move the needle in the immediate term.”But AI\\'s another moving target in a sector where, all in all, the vibe\\'s been rather topsy turvy.\"The mood has been that Meta is finally figuring out a lot of stuff, while we all of a sudden have questions about Google,\" said Shmulik. \"Some of those questions are about this quarter or this year, but I\\'ve already started to get a lot of questions from investors about 2024.\"Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

       "  'By Lena Masri(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Ron Wyden has called for the Biden administration to carry out an investigation after a Reuters report showed how Russian authorities are using facial recognition to curb dissent with the aid of U.S. technology.Wyden, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said that \"American technology shouldn’t be a linchpin in Russia’s authoritarian surveillance machine.\"\"The administration should thoroughly investigate allegations that U.S. chips are being used in Russia’s facial recognition and surveillance regime and do what it takes to cut off the flow of sensitive technology to Putin and his cronies,” Wyden told Reuters.His comments came in response to Reuters reporting last month that showed that surveillance and facial recognition have played an important role in the arrests of hundreds of protesters in Moscow -- and that after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, authorities began using facial recognition to prevent people from protesting.The facial recognition system in Moscow is powered by algorithms produced by one Belarusian company and three Russian firms. At least three of the companies have used chips from U.S. firms Nvidia Corp or Intel Corp in conjunction with their algorithms, Reuters found.In response to the Reuters findings, Nvidia and Intel said they cannot always know how their products are used and that they halted all shipments to Russia in March 2022 after the United States tightened export restrictions. Russian customs records showed the companies\\' technologies were still arriving in Russia via third parties between April 1, 2022, and Oct. 31 2022.Intel said it takes reports of continued availability of its products seriously and is looking into the matter. Nvidia said it complies with all applicable laws. \"If we learn that any Nvidia customer has violated U.S. export laws and shipped our products to Russia, we will cease doing business with them,\" an Nvidia spokesperson said.(Reporting by Lena Masri; Editing by Daniel Wallis)Related Quotes'],\n",

Learn MoreChipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.37%) have garnered much attention in recent years. Chip shortages and macroeconomic headwinds since 2020 dragged down countless stocks. Meanwhile, recent advances in markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing have made investors bullish again.\\xa0Despite market fluctuations, AMD has remained a solid growth stock with its shares up 870% in the last five years. The company's diversified business offers the opportunity to back multiple high-growth markets, making it a compelling stock investment.However, as with most things, there are pros and cons when it comes to this semiconductor company. Here's the bull vs. bear argument for AMD stock.\\xa0AMD's biggest competitor is no doubt Nvidia (NVDA 1.11%), with both companies rising to positions of dominance thanks to their success in consumer PC components. Their businesses flourished amid the COVID-19 pandemic as home-bound consumers drove up demand for tech. However, AMD and Nvidia also experienced similar stock declines of over 50% in 2022, hit by economic challenges and reductions in consumer spending.\\xa0As a result, Nvidia's stronger position in AI potentially threatens AMD's long-term success. An AI boom was kicked off last November when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an advanced chatbot capable of composing human-like dialogue. The platform's success has led countless companies to begin developing competing services. Meanwhile, Nvidia's role as the primary supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for ChatGPT has sent its stock soaring 85% in 2023. Comparatively, AMD's stock has risen 42% in the same period.GPUs are critical to run and develop AI software, with research from TrendForce revealing that ChatGPT utilized about 20,000 units in 2020. This figure is expected to soon increase to 30,000 GPUs as ChatGPT prepares for commercialization, and Nvidia is well-positioned to profit substantially from the increase. Moreover, recent benchmarks from Tom's Hardware, an online technology publication, have shown Nvidia's GPUs outperform AMD's in AI tasks. Consequently, ChatGPT competitors could be more likely to also turn to Nvidia for GPU power, increasing its lead over AMD in the market.\\xa0Despite AMD's weaker status in AI against Nvidia, it is pulling ahead in other aspects of chipmaking. The tech giant is a leader in processors and embedded products, and has an increasingly lucrative semi-custom chips business. AMD's solid diversification was its main driver of growth amid a challenging 2022, with revenue rising 44% in its fiscal year. The same year saw Nvidia's revenue increase by 0.2%, with its business primarily reliant on GPUs.In 2022, AMD completed its purchase of Xilinx, a company focused on producing specialized processors for industrial, aerospace and defense, and space applications. The acquisition led AMD's embedded segment to report a 1,700% revenue increase to $4.6 billion last year. Additionally, the company has quickly become a leading name in custom semiconductors. AMD's chips exclusively supply the graphics and processing power to Microsoft's Xbox Series X and Sony's PlayStation 5 consoles. The partnerships have garnered AMD an 83% market share in game console processors, with the company also supplying its chips to multiple handheld gaming devices.\\xa0Nvidia's leading market share in GPUs has given it an edge in AI. However, AMD's priority on growing in various areas of tech fortifies its business against temporary headwinds.\\xa0AMD's stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 30, which makes it a bit expensive. However, that figure has decreased by 26% since January 2022 and is preferable to Nvidia's forward P/E of 60. The company has a solid growth history, with its shares rising over 3,000% in the last decade. AMD's consistent gains make its high P/E less of a concern, as the company will likely continue growing over the long term.\\xa0AMD may be behind Nvidia in AI, but I wouldn't count it out. It remains a robust chipmaker with lucrative positions in multiple other high-profit areas of tech and is currently trading at a better value than Nvidia. So I'd side with the bulls on this one and say that AMD is an immensely attractive stock right now.\\xa0Dani Cook has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

       "  'Nvidia (NVDA) today announced the launch of its new and much-anticipated graphics card, called the GeForce RTX 4070.The graphics processing unit, or GPU, starts at $599 and will be available starting tomorrow. Its features include \"DLSS 3 neural rendering, real-time ray-tracing technologies, and the ability to run most modern games at over 100 frames per second at 1440p resolution,\" the company said in a statement.These enhancements are geared towards gamers looking for a high-quality visual experience, enabling games like \"A Plague Tale: Requiem,\" \"Dying Light 2,\" \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II,\" and \"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy\" to be played at a resolution of more than 100 frames each second.The announcement comes at a good time for Nvidia, which has seen its shares climb nearly 90% year-to-date. Notably, the graphics giant has been considered a key play for those looking to invest in artificial intelligence (AI). The company doubled down on AI at its GTC 2023 developer conference last month, announcing products like the DGX Cloud, a service that Nvidia says offers business customers the supercomputing abilities necessary to train generative AI models of their own.“We are seeing an acceleration in demand,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview. “We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for our DGX AI supercomputers. We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for inference, because of generative AI.”Even the new GeForce RTX 4070 has an AI angle. For gaming-focused creators who livestream or do video editing, the new GPU is linked to the Nvidia Studio platform, which includes tools that leverage generative AI like the Omniverse Audio2Face application. This all links up with a key feature of Nvidia\\'s strategy surrounding AI – giving creators individually and companies at-large the ability to leverage the tech however it best suits their business.“The impressive capabilities of generative AI have created a sense of urgency for companies to reimagine their products and business models,” Huang said in March statement around GTC. “We are at the iPhone moment of AI.”One example: Nvidia recently launched its new AI Foundations service, which will help companies build their own generative AI models. Ultimately, the chipmaker\\'s data center arm, which includes its AI initiatives, saw its annual revenue balloon from $2.98 billion in 2019 to $15 billion in 2022.From here, Nvidia still has room to run, Piper Sandler Analyst Harsh Kumar wrote in a March 29 note\"NVDA is able to leverage its unique hardware install base of ~50M GPU to help migrate customers towards an AI and or Omniverse solution,\" he said. \"AI software licenses are included with sales of enterprise level H100 servers and are also available via cloud services. In simple cases, this would allow teams across different continents to be able to work together in real time on complex designs.\"Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Exceptional responsiveness is maintained through NVIDIA Reflex, which reduces input lag between devices and monitors.Ray-tracing performance has also significantly improved, thanks to advancements like Shader Execution Reordering (SER), cutting-edge Opacity Micromap, and Displaced Micro-Mesh Engines. These innovations enable even the most demanding games to simultaneously implement multiple ray-tracing effects or even full ray tracing, also known as path tracing, for unparalleled realism and immersion.This potent combination of third-generation ray tracing and DLSS has resulted in a 16x leap in ray-tracing operations per pixel over the past five years. Adoption rates have soared, with over 400 RTX games and applications available, with adoption of DLSS 3 happening 7x faster than its predecessor.Class-Leading Performance and FeaturesCompared to the RTX 2070 SUPER, the GeForce RTX 4070 is on average 2.6x faster with DLSS 3, and on average 1.4x faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 with DLSS 3.DLSS 3 provides Ada Lovelace GPUs with a tremendous performance boost, but the GeForce RTX 4070 also excels in traditional games that do not include more advanced features such as ray tracing and DLSS.In these rasterized games, the GeForce RTX 4070 is on par with the GeForce RTX 3080 while running at nearly half the power — and offering an additional 2GB of memory. Additionally, the RTX 4070’s memory subsystem has been enhanced with 36MB of L2 cache and 12GB of ultra-high-speed GDDR6X memory.Perfect for Content CreatorsThe GeForce RTX 4070 GPU comes backed by the NVIDIA Studio platform, which enables content creators to work faster and smarter with RTX acceleration and AI tools. Serving creators from livestreamers to video editors, the platform supercharges 100 creative apps, provides lasting stability with NVIDIA Studio Drivers and includes a powerful suite of Studio apps, such as NVIDIA Omniverse™, Canvas and Broadcast.3D modelers rendering 4K scenes with the AI-powered DLSS 3 in NVIDIA Omniverse — a hub to interconnect existing 3D workflows, replacing linear pipelines with live-sync creation for real-time collaboration — can expect 2.8x faster performance than with last generation’s GeForce RTX 3070 Ti.Broadcasters deploying the eighth-generation NVIDIA video encoder NVENC, with support for AV1, will enjoy 40% better efficiency. Livestreams will appear as if bitrate was increased by 40% — a big boost in image quality for popular broadcast apps like OBS Studio. AV1 is already supported in Discord with a full release coming to YouTube via OBS Studio soon.Video editors will see 20% faster video export speeds, thanks to the eighth-generation NVIDIA encoder on the GeForce RTX 4070, along with AV1 incorporated into top video editing apps.And all creators can benefit from the new fourth-generation Tensor Cores for AI tools, providing a significant performance increase from the last generation.Where to BuyThe GeForce RTX 4070 will be available starting tomorrow at $599.An NVIDIA Founders Edition design will be available directly from NVIDIA.com and select retailers. Custom boards, including stock-clocked and factory-overclocked models, will be available from top add-in card providers such as ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, GALAX, GIGABYTE, INNO3D, KFA2, MSI, Palit, PNY and ZOTAC.About NVIDIASince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

Learn MoreNvidia (NVDA 1.11%) investors have been on a roller coaster in recent years. First, the COVID-19 pandemic led its stock to skyrocket thanks to a surge in consumer spending on tech. Then, macroeconomic headwinds caused the company's stock to plunge 50% in 2022. This year, Wall Street has grown bullish over Nvidia again, boosting its stock 85% since Jan. 1. Investors have rallied over the company's lucrative prospects in artificial intelligence (AI).\\xa0The volatility of Nvidia's stock in recent years highlights the importance of holding for the long term. For instance, despite recent fluctuations, the company's stock has risen 380% in the last five years. The projected growth of markets such as AI and cloud computing makes now an excellent time to learn more about this leading chipmaker. After all, Nvidia is likely to play a crucial role in their development. Here are three things about Nvidia that smart investors know.OpenAI stunned the tech world last November with the launch of ChatGPT, an advanced chatbot capable of producing human-like dialogue. The success of ChatGPT has triggered an AI race, where countless companies have pivoted their businesses to AI development, increasing demand for powerful hardware like Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).GPUs are necessary to run and develop AI software, and Nvidia has a promising position as the industry leader. Its dominating role in the market has led it to become the primary supplier of GPUs to ChatGPT, which has been a major driver in Nvidia's recent stock growth.According to TrendForce, ChatGPT required about 20,000 GPUs in 2020. That figure is expected to soon rise to 30,000 as the platform readies for commercialization, with Nvidia in a prime position to significantly profit from the increase in demand. Meanwhile, competing platforms currently under development could also turn to Nvidia for GPU power.In addition to AI development, Nvidia is profiting from the steadily growing cloud market. For over a decade, the company has partnered with cloud giant Amazon Web Services (AWS). The collaboration has seen Nvidia utilize its GPUs to power data centers worldwide, hosting AWS.Amazon Web Services holds a 34% market share in the cloud market, with Nvidia again seeking an industry leader to maximize its profits in a developing market, as it has done with ChatGPT. A Grand View Research report shows the cloud market hit $484 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 14% through 2030.\\xa0The pandemic boosted the industry, with countless companies moving their businesses online to suit hybrid working styles. However, AI development seems to have taken the reins now, with the technology capable of enhancing different facets of cloud services. Nvidia's strong position in both markets allows stock investors to back both technologies.Moreover, Nvidia's cloud and AI businesses now make up the majority of its income through its data center segment, accounting for 56% of the company's $27 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022. As a result, the segment's 41% year-over-year revenue growth is a positive sign of the chipmaker's future. Nvidia's rally in 2023 has made its stock look overpriced when considering its forward price-to-earnings ratio, which sits at about 60. However, the semiconductor company's stock remains 23% below its all-time high of $333 in November 2021, suggesting it has more room to rise.\\xa0The chipmaker got to its record high stock price as a leader in consumer PC components, thanks to a rise in people building custom computers for activities such as gaming and crypto mining. However, since then, Nvidia has pivoted toward less consumer-reliant industries, diversifying its business and making it less susceptible to economic declines.As a result, Nvidia's future stock growth will likely rely on the development of AI and cloud computing, which will only continue to advance. So alongside stock growth of more than 8,000% in the last decade, Nvidia is a no-brainer buy right now. The company has a history of stellar growth and solid positions in markets building the future.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreHindsight is a beautiful thing, and most of the time, the genius behind some of humanity's greatest innovations is only apparent looking backward. Nobody knew we needed computers until we had them, and the concept of a smartphone sounded ludicrous until... well... it wasn't.The same goes for investing. It's impossible to know ahead of time that a financial asset will increase in value by a life-changing amount -- whether it's a stock or a cryptocurrency. But it does happen, and the markets are filled with great examples.\\xa0I'm going to share three of them. Each one would have generated a gain of more than $10 million from a well-timed initial investment of $10,000, assuming the investor was still holding on today. Let's explore the details.\\xa0Nvidia (NVDA 1.11%) is currently one of the most exciting companies in the world. Its humble beginnings date back to 1993, when a trio of engineers (including the company's current CEO Jensen Huang) sought to bring 3D graphics to computer games and multimedia.\\xa0By 1999, the company had delivered the first-ever graphics processing unit (GPU), which trounced the performance of all of its prior chips. That's precisely when Nvidia's GeForce brand was born, and it still produces the world's most powerful GPUs. Today, those chips are the driving force behind advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), a rapidly growing industry Nvidia is leading.The company's hardware is responsible for training OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, and businesses across the globe will soon have access to the Nvidia DGX AI supercomputer through top cloud providers like Microsoft (MSFT -1.28%) Azure.\\xa0Nvidia stock was listed publicly in 1999 at $12 per share. After experiencing significant growth, management executed five stock splits to ensure the share price remained accessible to smaller investors. As a result, an investor who committed $10,000 at the company's initial public offering (IPO) would have 39,984 shares today with a cost basis of $0.25 per share.\\xa0Since Nvidia stock currently trades at $270.37, that investment would be worth a whopping $10.8 million now. But here's the better news -- the stock probably isn't done going higher.\\xa0Few companies have experienced as much long-term success as Microsoft. It started in software development in 1975, and its early successes like Windows and Word are still used by billions of customers today. But the company has aggressively expanded into other industries like hardware, gaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence -- all of which have contributed to its current $2.2 trillion market valuation.\\xa0Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure, assists businesses with their digital transformation. It can be used to store data and develop software, and thanks to Microsoft's multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, it provides customers with some of the most advanced AI tools on the market.\\xa0Microsoft has integrated the ChatGPT chatbot into its Bing search engine in an attempt to disrupt Alphabet's Google, which has a dominant 93% global market share. The pairing has incredible potential, and it's one of the reasons I think Microsoft could become the world's first-ever $5 trillion company.The company went public in 1986 at $21 per share. Following nine stock splits since then, IPO investors would now have a cost basis of $0.0729 per share, meaning they'd be holding 137,119 shares for their initial $10,000 purchase.\\xa0Microsoft stock trades at $291.60 per share today, so that $10,000 would be worth $39.9 million now.\\xa0No financial asset class has ever split the investment world down the middle quite like cryptocurrencies, and the debate continues to rage on. On the bullish side, people see highly transmissible digital tokens with the potential to replace traditional fiat currencies. But those with a bearish view don't see the benefit, and a lack of regulation makes owning crypto tokens rather risky. The evidence of that piled up in 2022, reaching a crescendo with the collapse of FTX, one of the world's largest exchanges.\\xa0Nonetheless, it's impossible to deny the surging returns some tokens have generated. Bitcoin (BTC 0.24%) is the largest of them all with a current market value of $546 billion, meaning it represents about 46% of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies in existence.\\xa0Bitcoin is a truly decentralized cryptocurrency. There is no one person or entity that controls it, which is in stark contrast to thousands of tokens created since. As a result, investors view Bitcoin not only as a currency to transact with, but also as a store of value because it's incorruptible. It runs on blockchain technology, which serves as a public ledger with records for every Bitcoin transaction, ever.\\xa0Bitcoin was launched in 2009, but the first recorded real-world transaction didn't happen until May 22, 2010. A person by the name of Laszlo Hanyecz used 10,000 Bitcoin to buy two pizzas from Papa John's, through an indirect transaction that included another individual named Jeremy Sturdivant, worth about $41.\\xa0That placed Bitcoin at a price of $0.004 at the time. The token was only trading on one known exchange back then, called BitcoinMarket, but an investor could have theoretically acquired a whopping 2.5 million tokens for $10,000.\\xa0Since one Bitcoin currently changes hands for $28,306, that initial investment would be worth a mind-blowing $70.7 billion today! But, of course, it would have taken nerves of steel to put $10,000 into such an unknown, speculative investment back then. And it would have taken true diamond hands to hold on to the tokens this entire time! Looking ahead, some Bitcoin analysts think there's still plenty of upside left in the tank.\\xa0Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn MoreOver the long run, Wall Street has shown time and again that it\\'s a wealth-building machine. Even though stock market corrections are commonplace, the broad-market indexes tend to rise over long stretches.Among the 11 sectors of the market, none has captivated investors\\' attention more than tech stocks. Since the end of the Great Recession (2007-2009), the tech sector has enjoyed nearly uninterrupted access to historically cheap capital. More than a decade of favorable monetary policy from the Federal Reserve allowed tech stocks to cheaply borrow in order to hire, acquire, and support innovation.Image source: Getty Images.Tech stocks were also Wall Street\\'s darlings during the recently ended first quarter. With virtually all mega-cap tech stocks rising by a double-digit percentage to start the year, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.21%) and technology-driven Nasdaq Composite benefited notably.\\xa0Unfortunately for tech investors, one new data point is sounding a warning on Wall Street.Less than two weeks ago, Cameron Dawson, the chief investment officer at NewEdge Wealth, offered some thoughts on the tech sector via Twitter. Dawson\\'s thread labeled tech stocks as being largely responsible for the gains the major indexes have enjoyed in 2023.However, Dawson also pointed to something tech investors may be ignoring or not giving enough attention: premium valuations in the sector.Tech\\'s PE has now jumped so much that it now trades at a 38% premium to the S&P. This is even higher than at the pandemic bubble peak in late 2021!Wild to think that pre-Powell pivot in 2019, tech traded at just a 4% premium to the market. pic.twitter.com/37qLb3zWXl\\n\\nHistorically, it\\'s not uncommon for price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples in the tech sector to be higher than the average P/E ratio of the S&P 500. Tech stocks not only tend to grow faster than most sectors of the market, but they\\'ve historically held up better during recessionary periods, as noted by Dawson. The smaller profit declines tech stocks experienced during the Great Recession and the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic helped the sector sustain a higher P/E ratio.But as of the end of March 2023, the aggregate P/E ratio of technology stocks was 38% higher than the S&P 500\\'s P/E ratio. This is an even higher premium than tech stocks exhibited in 2021, which is when the proverbial cheap capital spigots were on full blast. At the moment, the technology P/E premium, relative to the S&P 500, is double its five-year average.Normally, a high valuation by itself isn\\'t enough of a reason for investors to worry. But that\\'s not always the case.As an example, the S&P Shiller P/E ratio has a knack for forecasting eventual downside in stocks. I say \"eventual,\" because it doesn\\'t predict how long stocks, collectively, can remain pricey.When back-tested to 1870, there have been six instances where the S&P Shiller P/E ratio has crossed above and sustained 30, including February 2023. In the other five previous instances, the S&P 500 eventually lost at least 20% of its value. Again, stocks can remain pricey, on relative basis, for an extended period of time. Eventually, though, a bear-market-sized decline has always been the result.Premium valuations also become less tolerable during bear markets (as we\\'re in now), and when recessions arise. Though the U.S. isn\\'t in a recession, a trio of recession-probability indicators have provided a warning to investors.Historically, yield curve inversion have been bad news for the U.S. economy. 10 Year-3 Month Treasury Yield Spread data by YCharts. Gray areas denote recessions.For instance, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a recession probability tool that determines the likelihood of a U.S. recession within the next 12 months based on the spread (i.e., difference in yield) between the three-month and 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds. After 1966, anytime the probability of a recession has hit at least 40%, the U.S. has dipped into recession. It was 57.77% in March.\\xa0Additionally, the U.S. ISM Manufacturing New Orders Index, as well as the Conference Board Leading Economic Index, have presented data that suggests an increased likelihood of an economic downturn.Even though tech stocks have fared better than other sectors on an earnings basis during previous recessions, it\\'s not clear if investors will support this rich of a P/E premium to the benchmark S&P 500.Recently, I\\'ve highlighted a handful of tech stocks that aren\\'t attractive at their current valuations. This includes the king of the hill, Apple (AAPL -0.21%), as well as the top-performing mega-cap in 2023, Nvidia (NVDA 1.11%).Neither Apple nor Nvidia is a bad company. Apple has great leadership, a faithful customer base, and it\\'s repurchased more than $550 billion worth of its common stock over the past 10 years. Meanwhile, Nvidia is a major player in graphics processing units and is riding the artificial intelligence (AI) wave higher.But both companies have lofty valuations and a near-term growth problem. Even with historically high inflation as a tailwind, mediocre sales of Apple\\'s iPhone 14 have the company set to report a modest sales and profit decline in fiscal 2023, according to Wall Street estimates. Likewise, Nvidia\\'s highly profitable gaming unit has seen sales drop by around 50% as inventory gluts in the personal computing space take hold. Apple at an estimated 28 times fiscal 2023 earnings, along with Nvidia at a forecast 60 times fiscal 2024 earnings, aren\\'t attractive.But just because certain tech stocks are priced for perfection, it doesn\\'t mean there aren\\'t values to be had. Investors simply have to be smart about where they\\'re putting their money to work.A perfect example would be semiconductor stock Broadcom (AVGO -0.75%). Even with a healthy 28% gain in its share price over the trailing six months (as of April 7, 2023), Broadcom can still be purchased for just 15 times what Wall Street expects it to earn in 2023.Image source: Getty Images.What\\'s more, Broadcom tends to have a sizable order backlog. If the U.S. economy does, briefly, shift into reverse, Broadcom is able to lean on its hearty backlog to generate predictable operating cash flow. This backlog, coupled with the fact that Broadcom generates most of its sales from wireless chips found in next-generation smartphones -- smartphones and access to wireless service are practically basic necessities -- should provide a nice foundation for shareholders.It\\'s also important to think long-term. While valuation-driven and recession-based indicators can flash warnings from time to time, the stock market is still the same phenomenal wealth creator when measured over multiple decades.Sean Williams has the following options: short June 2023 $350 calls on Nvidia.
