"Why Nvidia Stock Jumped 34% in January
2023-02-09T03:17:49Z
Shares of Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%), the chip maker best known for its graphics processors, were soaring last month as the company seemed to benefit from a broader turnaround in tech stocks and as interest built in all things artificial intelligence (AI)-related following the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT.

According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished the month up 34%.

As you can see from the chart below, the stock gained steadily over the course of the month, significantly outpacing the Nasdaq, which jumped 11%.

There was little company-specific news out on Nvidia last month, but after the stock plunged 50% last year, investors seemed to spy a buying opportunity as market sentiment shifted in January.

Another Consumer Price Index report showing the inflation rate continuing to come down encouraged investors that the market could rebound without a deep recession, and confidence built that the Federal Reserve would slow down its interest rate hikes. At its meeting on Feb. 1, it did just that when it raised rates by just 25 basis points, its lowest increase in nearly a year.

Nvidia shares also seemed to move higher as interest surged in artificial intelligence following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November and as Microsoft and Alphabet both declared a pivot to AI, signaling that a new tech race was on in chat-powered search and other AI categories.

AI stocks like C3.ai also jumped toward the end of the month, and Nvidia seemed to catch a tailwind because it's generally considered the leader in AI chips. A majority of its revenue also comes from chips for data centers, which are expected to be in high demand as AI becomes the next frontier in technology.

Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and revenue is falling across the board due to an inventory glut. Recent reports from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices made clear that the fourth quarter is likely to be a challenging one for Nvidia.

Still, the company once again seems to be at the right place at the right time in the chip sector and is likely to benefit from the boom in artificial intelligence.

We'll learn more when Nvidia reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 22. Analysts are expecting another decline in revenue, calling for the top line to slide 21.4% to $6.01 billion and earnings per share to shrink from $1.32 to $0.81. However, investors will also be keen to hear management's comments on the evolution of AI, as that will be a greater determinant of the company's long-term performance."
"Nvidia Stock: Bear vs. Bull
2023-02-22T15:00:00Z
Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) shares have skyrocketed in 2023, rising 41% since Jan. 1. Investors have rallied as the company looks more likely to play a crucial role in the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, an advanced chatbot capable of producing human-like dialogue, in November 2022, all eyes have been on companies with the tech to drive the industry forward.

While Nvidia likely has much to gain from AI over the long term, a steep decline in the PC market in 2022 has increased its stock price volatility. Until the market recovers, knowing the best time to invest in Nvidia might be difficult.

As a result, there are bears and bulls regarding Nvidia's stock. So let's take a closer look at both arguments.

Amid an economically challenging 2022, the PC market was hit hard. Rising inflation led to steep declines in consumer spending on tech, with worldwide shipments of graphic processing units (GPUs) falling 42% throughout the year. Some of the industry's biggest players watched their stocks plummet, with Nvidia's, AMD's, and Intel's shares falling between 48% to 55% throughout 2022.

Last year's market declines led revenue in Nvidia's historically highest-earning segment to plunge. Its gaming segment, primarily made up of GPU sales, saw revenue fall 51% year over year in the third quarter of 2022 to $1.57 billion. While competitors like AMD and Intel suffered from the market's declines, Nvidia was hit the hardest thanks to its 88% market share in the consumer GPU market.

Nvidia's substantial stock decline in 2022 due to poor GPU sales, followed by a 41% rise since Jan. 1 based on AI prospects, has led to high volatility in its stock price. The discrepancy means the company's shares are currently trading at 62 times its earnings, as the recent rise is based on optimism that hasn't yet paid off financially.

Despite the short-term volatility, Nvidia's past stock performance might still make the company worth an investment. Its shares have risen 240% over the last five years and 6,600% over the last decade. As a result, it might be best to keep a long-term perspective with Nvidia's stock, making its current price a buy no matter the temporary headwinds.

Bull: Nvidia leads the way in two high-growth markets

While Nvidia's earnings suffered from a decline in the PC market, its saving grace was undoubtedly its strong position in data centers, which kept the company growing despite economically challenging conditions. In Q3 2022, data centers earned the largest portion of revenue, with the segment reporting a year-over-year revenue rise of 31% to $3.83 billion.

The immense growth is primarily owed to the $3483.98 billion cloud market, projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% through 2030 (per Grand View Research). Data centers are crucial to that growth, with GPUs like Nvidia's powering cloud titans such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure. As more employees opt to work from home and online businesses expand, the cloud market will grow, and so will the need for data centers.

Moreover, Nvidia's GPUs have the power to run and develop AI software, making the company's tech crucial to the burgeoning industry. The AI market was valued at $136.55 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 37.3% through 2030. With the almost limitless potential of AI in numerous industries from consumer tech, healthcare, design, education, self-driving cars, and much more, Nvidia could profit from the market's growth for decades.

Nvidia's shares have soared since Jan. 1, with its stock price not exactly aligning with its recent financial performance. With an earnings release in a matter of days and expectations of further declines in consumer GPU revenue, its stock could slide to a more appealing price.

However, it might be best to focus on Nvidia's long-term prospects, no matter the case. The company's stock has grown immensely over the last five and 10 years. Meanwhile, a pivot to data centers and AI could see its business soar over the next decade, making now an excellent time to invest in Nvidia's stock

"Better Growth Stock: Nvidia vs. Apple
2023-02-10T11:15:00Z
Tech stocks have been on the rise in 2023 after a sell-off the previous year. Investors are bullish over the prospects of swiftly developing industries such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality, and what they could mean for the companies actively pursuing them.

Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) and Apple (AAPL -1.80%) suffered stock slides in 2022 alongside macroeconomic headwinds. However, the new year has Wall Street optimistic, with both stocks up over 20% since Jan. 1.

As these tech stocks begin to recover, now might be an excellent time to invest in one of these high-growth companies. So, is Nvidia or Apple's stock the better buy? Let's take a look.

Nvidia shares plunged 50% throughout 2022 as consumer demand for PC components slipped. While the company's majority market share in discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) has propelled it into a position of dominance in the tech industry, it also led to significant losses in 2022 as worldwide GPU shipments fell 42%.

Despite the challenging year, Nvidia has proved its resilience in 2023 by pivoting its business toward a burgeoning market: artificial intelligence (AI). The move has pumped its stock up 55% year to date, as AI is increasingly likely to be a significant focus of future technology.

According to Grand View Research, the AI market was worth $136.55 billion in 2022 and will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% through 2030. Considering Nvidia's GPUs have the power to run and develop AI software, the company could have a fruitful future in the quickly growing market.

Moreover, Nvidia's recent partnership with Microsoft's Azure to build a massive cloud AI computer is only more promising for its outlook. Microsoft invested $1 billion in AI start-up OpenAI in 2019, which stunned the tech world last November with the launch of ChatGPT -- a chatbot that can create human-like prose based on prompts. The impressive software has led to reports that Microsoft is considering investing a further $10 billion in the start-up.

As one of the best growth stocks out there, Nvidia shares have risen 283% in the last five years and over 7,000% in the last 10. With its powerful GPUs in hand and a collaboration with one of the biggest names in AI, Nvidia likely has a lucrative future over the long term.

Apple could see new catalyst in rumored AR/VR headset

Like Nvidia, Apple's stock suffered from a burdened tech market in 2022, with its shares falling almost 27% throughout the year. However, reports that the company's biggest product release of 2023 will see it venture into virtual/augmented reality with a new headset have boosted its stock by 21% year to date.

While Apple is already home to a solid business through its current lineup of products and services, the new headset will allow the company to take advantage of a technology of the future. Worth $25.33 billion in 2021, the AR market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 40.9% through 2030 (per Grand View Research). Meanwhile, VR will see a CAGR of 15% in the same period.

In the past, mixed reality devices have predominantly been geared toward gamers. However, experts see the technology easily applied to fields such as healthcare, education, and more in the future. With Apple's past success in entering new markets and quickly rising to dominance, an investment in the tech giant could be an investment in a future leader of the industry.

Apple shares have increased 288% over the last five years and 825% in the last decade, solidifying it as one of the most reliable growth stocks on the market. While both Nvidia and Apple likely have a long future of growth ahead, Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the chart below shows its stock currently offers more value.

Additionally, Apple's forward P/E over the last year has remained far more steady than Nvidia's, which has seen steeper peaks and valleys. As a result, Apple is the more consistent and reliable stock, making it the better growth stock to invest in this month

"Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Alphabet
2023-02-20T12:10:00Z
After start-up OpenAI stunned the tech world in November 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, an advanced chatbot capable of producing human-like prose based on prompts, many companies pivoted their businesses to make some artificial intelligence (AI) connection. According to Grand View Research, the AI market was valued at $136.55 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37.3% through 2030 as the technology pushes numerous industries forward, such as healthcare, education, consumer tech, and more.

As a result, Microsoft's $1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019 looks like the foresight of the century, with the start-up's technology already being integrated into Microsoft's cloud platform Azure. In fact, recent reports say Microsoft is now considering a further investment of $10 billion into OpenAI to grow its stake in the lucrative market.

While Microsoft looks poised to be a major player in the future of AI, two other companies will likely help boost the industry over time: Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) and Alphabet (GOOG -1.89%) (GOOGL -1.94%). These companies have a lot to gain from the swiftly expanding industry, making their stocks compelling buys.

So is Nvidia or Alphabet the better AI stock? Let's assess.

As a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia is home to devices with the power to run and develop AI software. As a result, the company likely has a crucial role to play in the industry's growth.

Nvidia took a positive step in AI in November 2022, partnering with Microsoft's Azure to build a massive cloud AI computer. According to a press release from Nvidia, the collaboration will combine Azure with Nvidia's GPUs to ""help enterprises train, deploy, and scale AI, including large, state-of-the-art models."" Considering Microsoft's substantial role in AI thus far, Nvidia's partnership with the company could prove immensely lucrative over the long term.

In addition to a promising collaboration, Nvidia is taking independent steps in artificial intelligence by offering creators and developers a variety of resources on its site to use its products to develop AI software for a variety of industries, such as art, audio transcription, data science, and more.

Nvidia's stock price has skyrocketed 52% since Jan. 1, as Wall Street has grown bullish over the tech giant's prospects in AI. While many companies' future position in AI feels more hypothetical, Nvidia's tangible role in the industry, thanks to its powerful GPUs, makes its stock a reliable and compelling investment in the budding market.

Alphabet posted dismal fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb. 2, with revenue of $76.05 billion growing 1% year over year and missing analysts' expectations by $440 million. The company suffered throughout 2022, as macroeconomic headwinds triggered significant declines in ad spending. However, Alphabet recently announced a stronger focus on AI going forward, which could prove to be a lucrative pivot over the long term.

The company's priority on AI comes as the launch of ChatGPT has posed a substantial threat to Alphabet's search engine Google. While Google provides links to users' questions, ChatGPT is arguably more helpful by giving fully formed answers. Additionally, the software has only grown more threatening after recently being integrated into Microsoft's already-established search engine, Bing.

In one of its first moves to combat Microsoft, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 3 that Alphabet had invested close to $400 million in OpenAI rival Anthropic. While Alphabet is right to respond to recent AI developments with its own venture into the industry, the company's majority market share in search engines will likely be hard to beat, as AI upgrades to Google could make it an unconquerable force.

Alphabet held an 84% market share in search engines as of December 2022, while Bing's was at 8.9%. If the Google company can move quickly, it shouldn't have too much trouble keeping its dominance in the market.

"3 Things About Nvidia That Smart Investors Know
2023-02-09T15:23:00Z
In 2022, Nvidia's (NVDA -1.60%) stock plummeted 50%, burdened by a declining PC market. Demand for PC components still has a steep mountain to climb before it recovers, with worldwide shipments for graphics processing units (GPUs) falling 42% last year.

However, Nvidia stock has managed to rally in 2023, soaring 44% since Jan. 1. Wall Street has grown bullish over its prospects in artificial intelligence (AI), a market looking increasingly likely to play a significant role in future technology. As a result, now is an excellent time to learn more about this promising tech company.

Here are three things about Nvidia that smart investors know.

Despite a challenging 2022, Nvidia's business has soared over the long term. In the last five years, its stock has risen 274% and has skyrocketed 6,700% in the last decade. The company's swift development has been largely owed to its leading 72% market share in consumer graphics cards, which have swiftly grown in popularity in recent years as PC gaming has attracted more players.

While that majority market share hurt Nvidia in 2022, it has also elevated the company to be a key player in tech and given it the financial resources to expand to other areas of the industry. In fact, since 2018, Nvidia's revenue has increased 129% to $26.9 billion, while operating income has risen 84% to $7.2 billion.

Regarding Nvidia's expansion into other areas of tech, the best reason to invest in the company's stock is its crucial role in the future of AI. As a leader in GPUs, Nvidia is home to devices that have the power to run and develop AI software.

According to Grand View Research, the AI market was worth $136.55 billion in 2022 and will grow at a 37% compound annual rate through 2030. As a result, Nvidia is in a prime position to profit from that growth over the long term.

Moreover, in November 2022, Nvidia partnered with Microsoft's Azure to build a massive cloud AI computer. The collaboration will combine Nvidia's GPUs with Azure software which will ""help enterprises train, deploy, and scale AI."" With a cloud computing giant like Azure at its side and its powerful GPUs, Nvidia could flourish in AI.

While Nvidia is best known in video games for its contribution to the PC aspect of the market, the company also has a solid position in consoles. The tech giant exclusively supplies the graphics and processing power on Nintendo's Switch console through a customized system on a chip (SoC).

This partnership with one of the biggest names in video games has seen Nvidia's chips get into the hands of millions of consumers. According to Nintendo's latest earnings report, the console has sold 122.55 million units since it launched in 2017, making it the third-best-selling console of all time, only behind Nintendo's DS and Sony's PlayStation 2.

While Nvidia is still profiting from ongoing Nintendo Switch sales, a successor to the popular console has long been rumored. With 2023 being the sixth year since the original console launched, expectations are ramping up that Nintendo will release a sequel to the Switch in 2023 or 2024. In the past, Nintendo has always left between five to six years between console generations, with the Game Cube released in 2001, the Wii in 2006, Wii U in 2012, and the Switch in 2017.

As Nvidia is expected to once again supply its SoC for the next Switch, the company could receive a significant boost to revenue over the next one to two years."
"Nasdaq Bear Market: 1 Surefire Growth Stock to Buy Before It Starts Soaring
2023-01-29T10:10:00Z
When investors look back on 2022, the prevailing attitude will likely be, ""Good riddance!"" Over the past year, each of the major U.S. stock market indexes suffered at the claws of the bear market. The worst performer by a country mile was the Nasdaq Composite, which is still down 29% from its peak in late 2021.

Seasoned investors will note that corrections and bear markets are all part of the price of admission when investing. Keeping your head while others lose theirs is simple, but it isn't for the faint of heart. The good news is this: For investors with the resources and fortitude to weather the storm, market plunges offer the best opportunity to buy quality companies at a discount. History also shows that every previous sell-off has paved the way for an upcoming bull market.

One bear market bargain that's staring investors right in the face is semiconductor pioneer Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%). Looking at the big picture, it should become clear that investors should be buying this stock before it starts to soar.

The elephant in the room

Given the events of the past year, it's understandable that fair-weather investors have run for cover. In its fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 30, 2022), Nvidia's revenue declined 17% year over year to $5.9 billion. Even more concerning was the profit picture, as earnings per share (EPS) crashed 72% to $0.27.

Leading the decline was evaporating demand for Nvidia's graphics procession units (GPUs), which are the top choice among gamers. Gaming revenue tumbled 51% year over year as the combination of soaring inflation and rising interest rates weighed on discretionary spending. The rising cost of gas and groceries has taken precedence, putting the upgrade to the latest gaming chip on the back burner.

If the macroeconomic cloud had a silver lining, however, it was Nvidia's data center segment. Revenue rose 31% year over year, driven by robust demand from data centers and cloud computing operations.

Some investors, fearing the worst, headed for the exits, sending Nvidia stock plunging more than 42% from its late-2021 high.

However, staring too closely at the recent results tends to blur the big picture.

While past performance is no guarantee of future results, it can be informative. As recently as its 2023 fiscal first quarter (which ended May 1, 2022) Nvidia was putting up new milestones. The company reported record quarterly revenue that grew 46% year over year to $8.29 billion, while adjusted EPS grew 49% to $1.36.

The robust results came on the heels of the company's record fourth quarter and record fiscal 2022, as sales grew 61% to $26.9 billion, resulting in record EPS that grew 123% to $3.85 -- so the results were no anomaly.

Nvidia remains the undisputed leader in the discrete desktop GPU market, with a dominant 88% share in the third quarter, leaving crumbs for its rivals. This shows that Nvidia processors remain the industry standard.

When taken as a whole, the data clearly illustrates that Nvidia is being buffeted by the prevailing macroeconomic headwinds -- not from any failure involving the business. When the rebound begins, which it inevitably will, Nvidia's growth will return to its former glory, led by pent-up demand for its high-end gaming processors.

Even in the face of the economic downturn, the secular tailwind driving the adoption of cloud computing continues. Nvidia is the partner of choice for all the major cloud providers. Alphabet's Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure all rely on Nvidia's processors and accelerators, as does Alibaba Cloud, Baidu Cloud, and Tencent Cloud.

The need to speed data through the ether will only increase from here. Data centers experienced record adoption in 2021, spurring unprecedented growth last year. The need is so great, in fact, that half of the data centers being built are fully leased before construction is even completed. Furthermore, demand for data center capacity more than tripled year over year during the first half of 2022, led by many of the hyperscale operators listed above.

"If You Invested $10,000 in Nvidia in 2013, This Is How Much You Would Have Today
2023-02-20T13:00:00Z
While it might feel disheartening to look at a company's past stock growth and see what could have been, it's also a great exercise to see what's possible for the future. As a high-growth company, Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) has seen its shares skyrocket over the long term, illustrating the importance of holding stocks over many years. Doing so can safeguard your investment against temporary economic headwinds, like the ones that triggered steep declines for many companies in 2022.

Nvidia's stock fell 50% throughout last year. However, its shares have still retained 269% growth over the last five years despite the sell-off. And with that, let's look at how much a $10,000 investment in Nvidia's stock a decade ago, in 2013, would be worth today.

Founded in 1993, Nvidia went public in January 1999, with its stock soaring 55,000% since then. While most companies tend to experience the most growth in the beginning, Nvidia has still provided immense gains since 2013, as it almost singlehandedly founded the consumer graphics processing unit (GPU) market.

Before Nvidia, there was hardly a consumer (aka discrete) GPU market to speak of, with the company cashing in on the rising popularity of people building their own PCs for gaming and other purposes. As a result, Nvidia held an 88% market share in discrete GPUs as of the third quarter of 2022, according to Jon Peddie Research.

While declines in the PC industry in 2022 brought worldwide GPU shipments down 42% over the year, the market's past growth has propelled Nvidia into a dominating position in tech.

Since 2013, Nvidia's stock has soared by 7,050%. The colossal growth is almost unheard of compared to its peers, as seen in the table below.

Taking into account Nvidia's marginal dividends over the years, an investment of $10,000 in the company's stock in 2013 would be worth $807,205 today. The annual rate of return would be about 54%.

While Nvidia's stock is unlikely to soar another 7,000% over the next decade, it still has the potential for significant growth well into the future. The consumer GPU market is currently in a slump and will need time to recover. However, Nvidia's success in the space has given it the power and financial resources to find more lucrative applications for its high-powered devices.

Since Jan. 1, Nvidia's stock has shot up 55%, as the company's prospects in artificial intelligence (AI) have rallied investors. The tech giant's GPUs have the power to run and develop AI software, a market projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% through 2030. Since tech start-up OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of producing human-like dialogue, in November 2022, many companies have shifted focus to the industry.

Microsoft's $1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019 looks like one of the best decisions it has ever made, as the start-up's advanced software has been integrated into Azure and Bing. Meanwhile, Nvidia's recent partnership with Microsoft's Azure to build a massive AI computer is a promising step for its venture into the burgeoning market.

Another fruitful application for Nvidia's GPUs that is already boosting revenue is in data centers, propelled by the swiftly expanding cloud industry. In the company's third quarter of fiscal 2023, ended Oct. 30, 2022, its data center segment reported year-over-year growth of 30.5%, earning the largest portion of revenue at $3.8 billion. As the cloud market still has plenty of room for growth, with a projected CAGR of 15.7% through 2030, according to Grand View Research, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue seeing gains for years.

Nvidia has awarded patient investors with immense stock growth since 2013, achieving success by pushing technology forward in the consumer GPU market. Its crucial role in cloud computing and especially AI could see it do the same. The company may not offer the same growth over the next decade, with increased competition from Intel and AMD, but its dominance in tech and long-term outlook make its stock a screaming buy

"Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?
2023-01-27T10:00:00Z
Shares of Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) have been in red-hot form over the past three months, with the chipmaker's stock rising 50% as investors seem to have regained confidence in semiconductor stocks following a terrible 2022.

The PHLX Semiconductor Sector index is up an impressive 25% in the past three months, which might seem a tad surprising given the bleak semiconductor industry outlook for 2023. Gartner, for instance, forecasts a 3.6% decline in global semiconductor revenue this year.

Does this mean that Nvidia's rally could be cut short, especially considering the massive headwind it faces in the form of weak graphics card demand? Or should investors continue buying the stock in the hope that the chipmaker will sustain its momentum and crush the market in 2023? Let's find out.

Nvidia gets a price-target hike, but can it deliver?

Barclays has adopted a positive stance on chipmakers with exposure to the data center, smartphone, and personal computer (PC) markets.

Nvidia relies on data centers and PCs for a nice chunk of its revenue. It also stands to gain from the growing adoption of artificial-intelligence (AI) applications, which require massive computing power in data centers that Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) provide. As a result, Barclays has increased its price target on Nvidia stock to $250 from $170. The updated price target represents a 29% upside from current levels.

It won't be surprising to see the data center business turn out to be a key growth driver for Nvidia this year since it has been doing the heavy lifting for the company at a time when the gaming business is in the soup. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, for instance, Nvidia's data center revenue increased 31% year over year while gaming revenue was down 51%.

Moreover, the data center business produced 64% of the chipmaker's total revenue, which means that it can move the needle in a big way for the company.

A strong showing from the data center business will be the key to Nvidia's growth in fiscal 2024. Analysts anticipate the company will deliver a 9% increase in revenue in fiscal 2024 to $29.3 billion, as well as a 32% spike in earnings. Those numbers would be a major improvement over fiscal 2023's estimate of flat top-line growth and a 26% drop in earnings per share.

Nvidia may be able to meet or even exceed Wall Street's estimates as it is about to enter a new market. The chipmaker's ARM server CPUs (central processing units) are set to hit the market in 2023, and Nvidia is attacking this market at an opportune moment. ARM CPUs are expected to capture a quarter of the server processor market by 2025 as compared to 7.1% in the second quarter of 2022.

More importantly, the ARM server CPU market is expected to generate $16 billion in revenue in 2023, a number that could jump to $82 billion by 2030 as per estimates compiled by Statista. So the addition of ARM server processors to Nvidia's portfolio should give the company a solid opportunity to amplify its data center revenue from this year.

Also, Nvidia has a tight grip on the market for data-center graphics processing units (GPUs). IDC estimates that the company was sitting on a massive 91% of the enterprise GPU market in 2021, while rival Advanced Micro Devices' share was in the single digits.

Grand View Research estimates that sales of data center GPUs could increase at an annual rate of 23.5% through 2030 thanks to their use in supercomputers, AI applications, medical imaging, and drug research, among other areas.

So the healthy prospects of the data center CPU and GPU market could be a nice tailwind for Nvidia this year and beyond. The company might be able to deliver faster-than-expected growth thanks to the data center catalyst, and the stock could head higher as a result. But the bad news for investors is that Nvidia's rally has made the stock very expensive.

Nvidia stock needs to justify its price

Nvidia stock is now trading at a rich valuation. The chipmaker has a price-to-sales ratio of 17 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 82. The current earnings multiple is way higher than Nvidia's five-year average P/E of 59. Meanwhile, the sales multiple is also well above the S&P 500's reading of 2.4.

"1 Green Flag for Nvidia's Future, and 1 Red Flag
2023-02-17T10:15:00Z
Last year, Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) suffered the brunt of a sell-off that pulled its stock down 50% throughout 2022. However, tech is a forever-evolving industry that sometimes sees a company's luck turn on a dime as new developments bring new opportunities.

For instance, Nvidia has thrived in 2023 as its prospects in the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) industry sent its stock soaring 57% since Jan. 1. Wall Street has rallied with the knowledge that the company is home to devices capable of running and developing AI software.

However, prospective investors should be wary of Nvidia's threatened position in the slowing consumer graphics card processing (GPU) market.

Here is one green flag and one red flag for Nvidia's future.

One green flag for Nvidia: Pivoting to more lucrative markets

Nvidia's troubles in 2022 were mainly due to slowing demand in the PC market, as the rising cost of living led consumers to cut discretionary spending. However, Nvidia's GPUs are capable of much more than PC gaming, with the company likely to see substantial gains from cloud computing and AI well into the future.

According to Grand View Research, the cloud market was valued at $368.97 billion in 2021 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.7% through 2030. As data centers are crucial to that growth, Nvidia has profited significantly from the quickly developing market. In its third quarter of fiscal 2023, its data center segment reported year over year growth of 30.5%, earning the largest portion of revenue at $3.8 billion.

While it's still early days for AI and Nvidia's venture into it, the company has made positive strides in the $136.55 billion market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 37.3% through 2030. In November 2022, the tech giant partnered with Microsoft's Azure to begin building a massive cloud AI computer that will be powered by Nvidia's GPUs.

Microsoft is quickly becoming one of the biggest names in AI after investing $1 billion in tech company OpenAI in 2019. The start-up kicked off the AI race in November with the launch of ChatGPT, which wowed the tech world with its ability to produce human-like dialogue based on prompts. As a result, Nvidia's partnership with Microsoft could pay off in the long term.

One red flag for Nvidia: Trouble in consumer GPUs

While it is promising that Nvidia pivoted its business to two booming industries, that hasn't stopped the bleeding in its gaming segment -- mostly made up of revenue from discrete GPU sales. In 2022, the worldwide shipments of GPUs fell by 42% alongside a burdened PC market.

The decline in consumer demand wasn't helped by Nvidia missing the mark with the launch of its RTX 4000 series GPUs. It released the top-tier RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 in 2022, at a time when consumers were tightening their purse strings. The company unveiled the RTX 4080, priced at $1,199, 71% higher than the previous generation, the RTX 3080, which started at $699 in 2020. As a result, Nvidia's gaming segment suffered a 51% decline in revenue of $1.5 billion in its latest quarter.

According to Jon Peddie Research, Nvidia held an 88% market share in consumer GPUs in Q3 2022. With Advanced Micro Devices' growing position in the market and Intel entering in 2022 with the launch of its first consumer GPUs, it feels like Nvidia only has market share to lose.

The bright side is the PC industry will likely improve alongside easing inflation, and Nvidia's dominating position in the market will be to its advantage. Meanwhile, the company is expected to release its mid to low-tier 4000 series GPUs this year, which are always the most popular in the range. If Nvidia learned from its pricing fumble last year, it could come back strong with the new devices.

Despite a challenging 2022, Nvidia shares rose 280% in the last five years and around 7,000% in the last decade. It's a strong growth stock, and the company's shifted focus to cloud computing and AI has proven its resilience. Nvidia's unsteady position in GPUs is concerning but will likely improve over time, with data centers and AI being the driving force of its growth, making the company's stock a compelling long-term investment

"3 Chip Stocks to Consider in 2023
2023-02-23T14:55:00Z
The semiconductor industry has been one of the larger focal points of economists and lawmakers over the last couple of years. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced myriad challenges beyond public safety. Labor constraints and resulting supply chain challenges were amplified, with semiconductors being one of the most critical industries hit.

Despite these hurdles, companies such as Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.08%), and Marvell Technology (MRVL -3.09%), have demonstrated consistent resiliency. Let's break down the big picture for each company, and analyze why 2023 may be a good time to initiate or add to your position.

The leadership speaks for itself

For the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2022, AMD reported $5.6 billion and $23.6 billion in total revenue, representing a 16% and 44% year-over-year increase, respectively.

This level of growth should not be discounted by investors. Big tech companies such as Microsoft have been reporting that sales growth in personal computing is slowing down due to trepidation in consumer spending driven by inflation. Yet, despite these macroeconomic challenges, AMD has consistently demonstrated that it is nimble and can grow beyond supplying semiconductors for hardware devices, such as personal computers.

During the earnings call, AMD's CEO Lisa Su said: ""We accelerated our data center momentum and closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx, significantly diversifying our business and strengthening our financial model. Although the demand environment is mixed, we are confident in our ability to gain market share in 2023 and deliver long-term growth based on our differentiated product portfolio.""

This is an important passage for investors to digest. Su is illustrating that while there may be short- and intermediate-term challenges in the chip business, the company is still able to generate growth by its differentiated product suite, mainly through data centers. This dynamic makes sense. Despite tightening budgets, digital transformation remains a core component of data-driven growth for corporations of all sizes. However, it's obvious that there are long-term secular tailwinds for big data, and companies like AMD are poised to benefit regardless of broader economic conditions.

The company's strong quarter and full-year 2022 results demonstrate that AMD's leadership is hyper-focused on growth, and has shown investors that it can pivot in an efficient way, deriving growth from across the business and not relying on one particular segment.

Marvell Technology may not grab as many headlines as AMD or Nvidia, but this stock should not be overlooked. The stock cratered over 50% during calendar 2022, but is up roughly 19% year to date. Given the positive momentum experienced by competitors, namely Nvidia, some retail investors have likely averaged down or initiated positions in Marvell suspecting it is undervalued.

For the fiscal third quarter of 2023, ended Oct. 29, 2022, Marvell reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, or 27% year-over-year growth, which was a company record. Similar to AMD, Marvell generated impressive growth from its data center segment. Revenue from data centers came in at $627 million for fiscal Q3, which was 25% growth year over year.

The semiconductor landscape and the end markets it powers, such as cloud and enterprise networking, should continue to grow in the long run. While Marvell is much smaller than AMD and Nvidia in terms of revenue and market capitalization, the company is poised to succeed and continue gaining market share.

Nvidia is possibly the most exciting name in the semiconductor space. The company is investing aggressively to build what it calls the omniverse, which leverages quantum computing and robotics to construct interactive spatial models or renderings in real time. While this this type of technology sounds like something out of science fiction, it is developing and coming sooner than one might think. The use cases and end markets for this augmented reality are limitless.

"5 Stocks That Moved the Market in January
2023-02-06T11:20:00Z
January gave investors hope that the bear market is finally ending. The S&P 500 rose 6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped more than 10%. A handful of important market trends emerged thanks to evolving risk tolerance and growth expectations.

These five stocks all made big moves that highlight some of those key trends as we look to February and beyond.

Shares of electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (TSLA -2.57%) charged higher in January thanks to a positive earnings report and a rebound for growth stocks in general. Tesla reported record quarterly revenue, and it narrowly exceeded analysts' expectations for both sales and net income. Wall Street was pleased with Elon Musk's commentary on production forecasts and demand for 2023, and it seems the company could conceivably produce more than two million vehicles this year. Investors did not seem particularly concerned with Tesla's shrinking gross margin and operating cash flows.

Growth stocks have taken a beating over the past year as investors adjust valuations downward to reflect higher interest rates and slowing economic growth. Those issues are still prevalent, but we're seeing signs that stock prices may have overcorrected during the difficult year. This is most apparent for high-growth stocks, such as EV makers, with Tesla rising along with its peers Lucid and Rivian. The rapid rebound of beaten-down growth industries was a major market catalyst last month.

Semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) climbed nearly 35% last month, despite no major positive news coming out for the company. Nvidia was among the growth stocks that clawed back some of the major losses sustained over the past year, but it also benefited from momentum among semiconductor stocks.

The cyclical microchip industry is likely to struggle with weak consumer electronics sales over the next year, but investors are optimistic about long-term demand from the artificial intelligence, data center, and automotive markets. Nvidia and its peers seem to have partially navigated the issues posed by high inventories and supply chain disruptions. Both of those issues previously dragged on semiconductor stocks.

There was room for optimism in January, and that spurred an ongoing recovery for Nvidia.

Block (SQ 4.33%) joined the growth stock rally in January, rising 30% in the month. The fintech stock benefited from some of the catalysts already discussed above, but it also received a boost from cryptocurrency markets.

Block generates most of its cash flow from payment processing, transfers, and investment services. However, its significant Bitcoin holdings and association with blockchain technology mean that the stock tends to rise and fall with major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin rose nearly 40% relative to the U.S. dollar in January, driving crypto-related stocks higher. Shares of Coinbase were also buoyed.

Block might have some room to run higher now that it has a more reasonable valuation relative to its operational results. If it continues to grow and generate cash flow, there's a real opportunity for big returns. However, it probably needs cooperation from cryptocurrency prices to sustain its gains near term.

Airbnb (ABNB -2.18%) rose to prominence by occupying the intersection of travel, the burgeoning sharing economy, and a popular marketplace business model. It quickly disrupted the lodging and online booking industries, and its price-to-sales valuation quickly rose to 35 after its IPO, near the top of the pandemic bull market.

That valuation wasn't sustainable, and high interest rates combined with recession fears caused Airbnb to drop along with other companies across the travel industry. Now that the stock has a more reasonable (but still premium) P/S valuation of 9.7, it has some room to build on its 30% rally last January, which was supported by bullish quarterly figures from major airlines. Airbnb stood out from the pack, but it was also a great month for booking services, cruise lines, airlines, and hotel operators.

"These 3 Stocks Are Ending the Nasdaq Bear Market
2023-02-01T13:38:20Z
Despite its stumble to start the current trading week, the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) is up 12% from the low point it reached near the end of last year, and it reached a four-month high on Friday. This is the best stretch we've seen from the index since 2021, before the recent bear market took shape.

If this is the shape of things to come, that bear market may well be ending.

Before jumping to such a conclusion though, be aware that the underlying support for this rally is extremely lopsided. Specifically, it's top-heavy. A trio of large caps (mega caps, actually) -- Tesla (TSLA -2.57%), Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%), and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META -0.96%) -- are doing the vast majority of the heavy lifting. While you would typically expect to see powerhouse stocks resume their leadership of a struggling market when it's ready to recover, this isn't quite how you want to see it happen.

The aforementioned stocks haven't just had solid performances recently. They've catapulted. Meta's up by more than 22% since the end of last year. Nvidia shares rallied by nearly 32% in January. Tesla stock is up 36% year-to-date, and half of that gain materialized in just the past week. The rest of the Nasdaq Composite is struggling to keep up. It's these three stocks, in fact, that have largely pulled the composite out of its funk. No other mega caps even come close to beating the broad market in January.

And there's the rub. Most of the Nasdaq's other major names are bogging the rally down rather than boosting it. Not even Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) are lending a helping hand -- even though they've made gains, they are lagging the Nasdaq Composite's recent performance.

That's not necessarily the end of the world. No two stocks ever dish out the exact same performances, after all. That's why the Nasdaq Composite exists in the first place -- it's meant to reflect the market-capitalization-weighted performance of all Nasdaq-listed stocks.

But that's also how and why the composite's recent strength could be misleading. Tesla's market cap alone accounts for roughly 3% of the Nasdaq Composite's total value. Nvidia's influence isn't far behind Tesla's. Meta Platforms makes up roughly 2.3% of the composite's total value. By themselves, these proportions aren't earth-shattering. Together, however, they make up more than 8% of the Nasdaq Composite's total market cap. Combine that degree of impact with the huge gains they've each recently achieved, and what you get are a heavily skewed index and a poorly balanced advance.

In simpler terms, were it not for Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla, the Nasdaq Composite's recent rally would not be anywhere near as impressive as it has been. The index might not even be toying with the prospect of exiting its bear market.

Perhaps worse, looking back just a bit further reveals that Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia were among last year's biggest Nasdaq-listed losers, leaving them ripe for exaggerated bounces now. Ditto for Alphabet and Amazon, albeit to a lesser degree. The composite's recent rally may mostly be the result of sheer volatility.

Don't misunderstand. A stock's recent history should have little to no bearing on an investor's decision to buy or sell it. The two most important questions any investor should ask before making a trade are (1) does this company have compelling long-term prospects, and (2) does this stock's price fairly reflect those prospects and the risks associated with them?

This isn't about a stock-picking approach, however. This is about understanding how market indexes work, and how they can sometimes paint a misleading picture. In this case, the Nasdaq Composite's rally may not be as well-grounded as it seems ... at least not yet.

It matters because stocks tend to move as a herd, with the majority of them taking their directional cues from the market's most-watched names. If Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia can't sustain their rallies, many other stocks are apt to follow suit with pullbacks of their own.

"Is Nvidia Stock Still a Buy After Increasing 90% Since October?
2023-02-09T14:56:08Z
Amid a nasty down cycle for the semiconductor industry, Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) has rallied some 90% off lows from mid-October 2022. That's confounding, given that fellow semiconductor design peers have said that chip market growth may not make a comeback until this summer, and geopolitical tensions are heating up, with the U.S. banning exports of advanced chip technology (an Nvidia specialty) to China.

As of this writing, Nvidia stock trades for over 94 times trailing-12-month earnings and 44 times one-year forward expected earnings. Whether it's still a bear market or a new bull market has already begun (led by the semiconductor space), that kind of valuation is tough to stomach. But even more interesting is why the market suddenly has an appetite for risk again. What's going on with Nvidia, and is it really a good buy right now?

Before discussing the reason Nvidia has rocked the market's early 2023 rally, let's go back in time just a few years to 2018, another rough year for the semiconductor market. There were the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hikes (albeit nowhere close to as aggressive as those of 2022) and a downturn in chip demand, exacerbated by the U.S.-China trade war. The market overall didn't do particularly well. Nvidia stock got hit hard, but then started 2019 off hot.

Investors then realized they had gotten ahead of themselves in the first half of 2019, and Nvidia came crashing down again midway through the year -- before ultimately starting its meteoric rise headed into the pandemic. All the while, revenue was falling, and Nvidia stock traded for a high premium (though not as high as now).

I cite this chart not because I think the company is headed for a repeat of 2019. However, Nvidia has already forecast a decline in revenue (expected to be down about 21% year over year) for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 (the three-month period that ended in January). The present situation might wind up rhyming with 2019, though.

If Nvidia follows a similar path as other chip designers, it will forecast more weakness in revenue in the next couple of quarters, as consumer electronics spending is way down compared to last year. Some enterprise spending has also been weakening as data center computing system manufacturers work through a bit of excess inventory.

In other words, the market may have gotten ahead of itself again, running up Nvidia's stock in recent months. I fully expect a bumpy path forward, at best, in 2023.

Why Nvidia stock is up anyway, and why it could be much higher in five years

So, why is Nvidia stock soaring? I suspect it has a lot to do with the viral success of ChatGPT, Microsoft's ensuing investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and other big tech companies' responses unveiling their own consumer-facing generative artificial intelligence (AI) services.

For years, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been talking about the coming explosion in AI inference. Inference is basically when you request AI to compute a task and it comes back with an answer, like when you ask ChatGPT a question and it provides a conversational response. AI inference requires massive computational power. AI isn't new, but until this point, tasks were (mostly) pretty simple -- like autocorrect, autofill suggestions, or recommender systems that suggest videos for you to watch.

In a succession of earnings calls back in 2020, Huang explained that the majority of simple AI inference work like this was done by legacy CPUs (historically, the ones Intel makes, but Advanced Micro Devices has been rapidly chipping away at that market). But as AI models have grown in complexity, something more than a CPU has become necessary. Enter Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) chips.

ChatGPT thus embodies the coming tidal wave of business Nvidia could receive in the coming years as data centers need further revamping to accommodate new AI services. Interestingly, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on the company's Q4 2022 earnings call that ""95-plus percent of [cloud customers'] installed base is Intel."" That was in reference to data center CPUs (again, a market AMD has been stealing), but it underscores the massive opportunity Nvidia still has ahead of it as these cloud and AI data center computing units need their architectures updated for a new era.

"4 Surefire Stocks to Buy in the Next Bear Market
2023-02-17T15:22:39Z
One could argue that Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%), Global-e Online (GLBE -2.05%), Cadence Design Systems (CDNS -1.47%), and CrowdStrike (CRWD -0.14%) make great dollar-cost-averaging buys regardless of valuation, thanks to their incredible businesses. However, with each stock sporting a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 12 or more, they will not show up in anyone's value stock screeners anytime soon.

Adhering to the axiom that ""premium businesses trade at premium valuations,"" investors may be wise to put these surefire stocks on a bear market watch list, where they can capitalize on more attractive prices.

With that said, let's find out what makes these stocks worthy of their lofty valuations and see why they are great buy candidates in any upcoming bear market.

While Nvidia and its full-stack accelerated computing platform are technologically overwhelming to most, the megatrends supporting its bull case are much more straightforward.

First, Nvidia's core data centers and gaming markets, which accounted for 51% and 38% of sales in the first half of 2023, should continue booming over the next decade. Though the company's gaming unit saw sales drop by 51% in the third quarter compared to the prior year, it boasts 200 million gamers on its GE Force platform.

Hurt by its customers lightening their inventory after the pandemic boom, the segment should return to growth over the next several quarters as the gaming industry continues its transition to the cloud.

Meanwhile, its data center unit grew sales by 31% in Q3 and looks superbly positioned to thrive alongside the rise of artificial intelligence AI. For example, as the hype around ChatGPT persists, it is worth remembering that thousands of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) trained its models.

Additionally, the company averaged a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 22% over the last decade. ROIC measures a stock's profitability compared to its debt and equity, with a mark above 20% considered outstanding.

As stocks with higher ROICs are historically proven to beat their peers, Nvidia's profitability and growth prospects make it a great business to consider at a discount in the event of a bear market.

Helping its customers ""go global and be local,"" Global-e Online enables cross-border, direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales for its merchants worldwide. Supporting over 30 languages, 100 currencies, and 150 payment methods, Global-e boosts its merchants' international conversion rates through the low-friction shopping experience provided by its platform.

Supporting localized pricing, duties and taxes, shipping options, and even various after-sale processes, the company tackles the complexities of international sales for its merchants.

Behemoths like Walt Disney, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Mattel have turned to Global-e to help their global expansion. Not to mention that Shopify and Global-e partnered in 2021 to make the latter the exclusive cross-border services provider for the e-commerce juggernaut's growing list of merchants.

Growing sales and gross profit by 79% and 92%, respectively, in Q3, Global-e is already in hypergrowth mode, despite the Shopify integration launching in totality over the coming quarters.

Ultimately, Global-e Online's niche of battling the mundane intricacies of global sales gives it a unique moat as it grows, doing something no other companies want to or can do. As this moat continues to widen over time, investors would be wise to consider scooping up shares of Global-e if lower prices appear.

Like Nvidia, Cadence Design Systems may not be for the technologically faint of heart. Offering software, services, and intellectual property-based (IP) products, Cadence helps its customers design, assemble, examine, and verify integrated circuits (ICs), chips, and electronic systems.

In simplest terms, the company's products are critical to designing semiconductors and advanced electronics almost everywhere in today's world. For example, each of the top 20 semiconductor companies in the world uses its digital design and signoff software.

"Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?
2023-02-14T14:37:00Z
Nvidia's (NVDA -1.60%) stock has shot up over 51,000% since it went public in 1999. And with its 45% rise year to date, it might feel like the best time to buy this tech stock is well past. However, Nvidia is a growth stock for a reason, with its crucial role in developing future technology likely to keep the company's shares rising for the long term.

Despite the significant rise in Nvidia's stock in 2023, its price is still 36% below the all-time high it hit in November 2021. The difference suggests there's still plenty of room for Nvidia's stock to grow for patient investors. Here's why it's not too late to buy shares in Nvidia.

Last year, Nvidia suffered one of its worst years as its stock plunged 50% throughout 2022. The declines came as macroeconomic headwinds reduced consumer demand for tech, with worldwide shipments for desktop graphics processing units (GPUs) plummeting by 42%. As Nvidia held an 88% market share in discrete GPUs in the third quarter of 2022, the decline in demand was detrimental to its financials.

In Q3 fiscal 2023, ended Oct. 30, 2022, Nvidia's revenue fell 16% year over year to $5.9 billion. The decline primarily came from its GPU-reliant gaming segment, which saw revenue decrease by 51%, earning $1.5 billion.

However, a challenging 2022 has barely been a blemish on Nvidia's long-term growth. The company's stock has climbed 266% over the last five years and 6,700% over the last decade. This stellar stock growth has come alongside a 129% rise in revenue since 2018, hitting $26.9 billion, and a 164% increase in operating income of $10 billion.

Nvidia's focus on PC gaming hurt its business in 2022 as nearly all consumer-reliant companies felt the strain from a burdened economy. However, other, more lucrative applications for its GPUs will likely see the company continue on its current growth trajectory for decades.

Before Nvidia, there was hardly a consumer GPU market to speak of yet. The company almost single-handedly founded the industry and took full advantage of the rise in popularity of PC gaming, which has seen millions of gamers worldwide custom-build their own computers and turn to Nvidia for graphics processing. The PC gaming market may be down, but the company's success in the industry has granted it the funds and power to pivot its business to more lucrative areas of tech.

In Q3 2023, Nvidia's data center segment brought in the most revenue, reporting growth of 30% and hitting $3.8 billion. The rise is largely owed to the booming cloud industry, valued at $368.97 billion in 2021, and expected to see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.7% through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Data centers are crucial to that growth, with Nvidia's GPUs capable of running leading cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's Azure.

Moreover, Nvidia's 45% stock rise since Jan. 1 has mainly been fueled by its prospects in artificial intelligence (AI). The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of producing human-like dialogue, in November 2022 shined a light on AI and its significant role in future technology. As Nvidia's GPUs have the power to run and develop AI software, investors have grown bullish over its future.

The AI market was worth $136.55 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 37.3% through 2030 (per Grand View Research). Considering Nvidia partnered with Azure in November to build a massive cloud AI computer, the company has made positive strides in the burgeoning industry.

Nvidia has enjoyed monster growth since its founding in 1993. However, its consistent growth over the long term and prospects in two quickly developing industries mean it's not at all too late to invest in its stock."
"2 No-Brainer Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever
2023-02-17T22:00:00Z
Recently, the tech sector has been challenging for investors as pandemic-era boons fade and rising interest rates increase the cost of capital while discounting the value of future growth.

With substantial 2022 declines, Amazon (AMZN -2.42%) and Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) haven't escaped the carnage. That said, both companies have what it takes to regain their long-term growth trajectories.

1. Amazon should recover in the long run

Up 18% year to date, Amazon stock is beginning to make up for some of its crushing losses in 2022. However, there is still work to be done. While some investors might be less than impressed after weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, Amazon's challenges look temporary. And the tech giant's long-term growth thesis remains rock solid.

While Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings jumped 9% year over year to $149.2 billion, net income fell by 97% to just $300 million as high inflation and cost-cutting among Amazon Web Services clients cut into margins. That said, these results do not necessarily reflect Amazon's long-term profit potential. As a cyclical business, it is highly sensitive to temporary changes in the economy and can bounce back when conditions improve. The company still retains its industry leading scale, which creates network effects (the advantages a platform gains as more people use it).

Amazon's size also gives it a competitive advantage in digital advertising, where its large, shopping-motivated user base allows clients to better target customers. The ad business grew by 19% to $11.6 billion and will provide another source of diversification and sustainable growth.

With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 57, Amazon stock is not cheap compared to near-term earnings forecasts. But investors should remember that the company is going through a down cycle and retains all the advantages it needs to recover over the long haul.

Up 59% year to date, Nvidia is bouncing back from recent declines -- although shares are still down 31% from their all-time high of $333.41, reached in late 2021. The tech giant faces slowdowns in the gaming and cryptocurrency mining markets, which make extensive use of its GPU chips. That said, pivots to new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) could help power the next leg of expansion.

In a fireside chat style conversation with the Haas School of Business, University of California Berkeley, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI chatbot ChatGPT is ""one of the greatest things that has ever been done for computing."" He said he believes it could revolutionize the tech industry by allowing people to automate difficult programming tasks and unlock productivity. From an investor's perspective, this is a huge deal for Nvidia because its industry leading GPU chips are crucial for powering this burgeoning technology.

Analysts at Omdia believe Nvidia has a staggering 80% market share in the AI processor market. And the ChatGPT platform used 10,000 Nvidia GPUs to train its model, so if this technology is as revolutionary as many expect, it will be a long-term driver of revenue growth and diversification.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, ended Oct. 30, Nvidia's revenue dropped 17% to $5.93 billion on weakness in the gaming and professional visualization segments. But this was partially offset by strength in data center, which jumped 31% to $3.83 billion. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 49, shares are valued significantly higher than the S&P 500's average of 22. But the premium looks fair, considering Nvidia is at the bleeding age of a potential AI revolution.

Economic moats are hugely important when it comes to a company's staying power. While industry leading companies like Amazon and Nvidia can sometimes go through near-term challenges, their competitive advantages can help them bounce back over the long term, making both stocks look like excellent buys."
"Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-02-23T01:30:32Z
Good afternoon. My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA's fourth quarter earnings call. [Operator instructions] Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference.

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. With me today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, president and chief executive officer; and Colette Kress, executive vice president and chief financial officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website.

The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.

These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, February 22, 2023, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.

Thank you, Simona. Q4 revenue was $6.05 billion, up 2% sequentially, down 21% year on year. Full year revenue was $27 billion, flat from the prior year. Starting with data center.

Revenue was $3.62 billion was down 6% sequentially and up 11% year on year. Fiscal year revenue was $15 billion and up 41%. Hyperscale customer revenue posted strong sequential growth, though short of our expectations as some cloud service providers paused at the end of the year to recalibrate their build plans. Though we generally see tightening that reflects overall macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe this is a timing issue as the end market demand for GPUs and AI infrastructure is strong.

Networking grew but a bit less than our expected on softer demand for general purpose CPU infrastructure. The total data center sequential revenue decline was driven by lower sales in China, which was largely in line with our expectations, reflecting COVID and other domestic issues. With cloud adoption continuing to grow, we are serving an expanding list of fast-growing cloud service providers, including Oracle and GPU specialized CSPs. Revenue growth from CSP customers last year significantly outpaced that of data center as a whole as more enterprise customers moved to a cloud-first approach.

On a trailing four-quarter basis, CSP customers drove about 40% of our data center revenue. Adoption of our new flagship H100 center GPU is strong. In just the second quarter of its ramp, H100 revenue was already much higher than that of A100, which declined sequentially. This is a testament of the exceptional performance on the H100, which is as much as nine x faster than the A100 for training and up 30x cluster in inferencing of transformer-based large language models.

The transformer engine of H100 arrived just in time to serve the development and scale out of inference of large language models. AI adoption is at an inflection point. Open AI's ChatGPT has captured interest worldwide, allowing people to experience AI firsthand and showing what's possible with generative AI. These new types of neural network models can improve productivity in a wide range of tasks, whether generating text like marketing copy, summarizing documents like [Inaudible], creating images for ads or video games or answering customer questions.

"Wall Street's Happy About These 2 Winning Tech Stocks
2023-02-23T14:28:45Z
The stock market has been under pressure this week, as investors have grown concerned that January's big gains in the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -1.69%) and other major stock indexes could prove to be just another head fake in a bear market that has lasted more than a year now. Yet market participants seemed a little more comfortable with the prospects for stocks on Thursday morning, as the Nasdaq rose nearly 1% in premarket trading.

A pair of tech stocks reported their latest financial results overnight, and that helped build more positive sentiment on Wall Street. In particular, strong numbers from Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) and Alibaba Group (BABA -5.48%) lifted their respective share prices and brought optimism to the tech stock sector more broadly.

Shares of Nvidia posted a powerful jump on Thursday morning, rising 12% in premarket trading. The semiconductor giant reported fiscal fourth-quarter financial results for the period ending Jan. 29, and investors reacted positively to all the things that Nvidia said to feed the growing hype about artificial intelligence (AI).

Nvidia's backward-looking numbers actually weren't all that great on their face, although investors were pleased to see some signs of the business turning itself around. Revenue of $6.05 billion was down 21% year over year, but it was slightly higher than Nvidia brought in during the third quarter three months earlier. Similarly, adjusted earnings of $0.88 per share were down 33% from the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year, but they jumped 52% from three months ago.

However, Nvidia played up its prospects for innovative products, particularly in the AI space. The chipmaker touted its new AI supercomputer, discussed AI-powered neural rendering in its video gaming division, and announced plans to offer AI as a service to large enterprise customers.

Nvidia gave favorable guidance for the current quarter, projecting revenue of around $6.5 billion and favorable trends on key operating metrics as well. Even though the company is still vulnerable to ongoing macroeconomic factors, particularly in markets like China, Nvidia believes that it's at an inflection point from which it intends to launch a new chapter in its growth story -- and could become an AI stock in its own right.

Elsewhere, shares of Alibaba Group climbed 5% early Thursday. The Chinese internet giant reported fiscal third-quarter financial results for the period ending Dec. 31, 2022, and shareholders generally liked what they saw in Alibaba's immediate future.

Alibaba's fundamental business performance was impressive. Revenue gains came in at just 2%, with Alibaba posting $35.9 billion in sales. However, adjusted net income grew 12% year over year to $7.24 billion. That produced earnings per American depositary share of $2.79, which was 14% higher than in the year-earlier period.

CEO Daniel Zhang noted that Alibaba had to overcome a lot of headwinds during the quarter in order to deliver such solid performance. In particular, the relaxing of zero-COVID policies led to a huge surge in COVID-19 cases, which in turn had disruptive impacts on the Chinese economy. However, Zhang is optimistic that China has turned the corner, and he expects that improving consumer sentiment will help drive greater levels of economic activity that in turn will create new opportunities for Alibaba to grow.

Alibaba investors have hoped that the pandemic would have less of an impact on the Chinese economy in 2023. With its own explorations of artificial intelligence capabilities and the likelihood that foreign competitors will have difficulty introducing internet-based AI to the Chinese market, Alibaba has the upper hand in working on its own AI initiatives."
"Bargain Shopping in 2023? These Growth Stocks Could Set You Up for Life
2023-02-01T10:25:00Z
History shows that buying and holding growth stocks is one of the best ways to build wealth for retirement. It's only when stocks of great companies fall that investors can buy shares cheap enough to earn extraordinary returns.

Two of the best tech stocks to buy right now are Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) and Meta Platforms (META -0.96%). These stocks were big losers in 2022, but that's why they might be able to deliver impressive returns from here. These companies are leaders in their respective industries and are continuing to invest in new products and technologies to drive more growth.

Share prices of the leading graphics processing unit (GPU) supplier rallied at the end of 2022 after a brutal sell-off last year. One reason to consider buying the stock on the dip is Nvidia's leading position in one very important market to the global economy.

Nvidia sells chip hardware and systems to enterprises in the burgeoning data center market. These GPU accelerators are mission critical for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to process massive data workloads. Spending on data centers is only going to grow over time as AI becomes widely adopted for everything from oil exploration to chatbots.

Nvidia is also a leader in gaming, which is a big reason the stock fell last year. Gaming is the company's second-largest revenue source after data center. Lower demand for gaming GPUs led to oversupply in the retail channels, which will take a few quarters to work through. This is why gaming revenue was cut in half last quarter, causing Nvidia's total revenue to decline 17% over the year-ago quarter.

Nvidia has been through these demand cycles before, but it's important to keep the long-term growth trajectory in perspective. Consider that Nvidia's $5.9 billion in total revenue last quarter was double the same quarter five years ago. It's this long-term growth trajectory that should keep the stock climbing higher over the long term.

There are several growth catalysts to watch this year.

First, Nvidia is preparing to launch its RTX 40-series gaming chips for laptops. Gaming demand could be bottoming out right now. The recent launch of the GeForce RTX 4090 for consumer PCs sold out quickly, which shows a solid floor of demand in the gaming market.

Plus the company is launching the new Hopper chip architecture for data centers, which is designed to handle the latest types of data workloads.

Nvidia is also set to launch the ""Grace"" central processing unit (CPU). This positions Nvidia to go after the $30 billion server CPU market, which was dominated by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. For Nvidia, Grace rounds out an impressive offering of data center products across GPUs, CPUs, data processing units (DPUs), networking equipment, and software, which combined means a $300 billion addressable market.

Nvidia should bounce back. It provides the technological backbone of artificial intelligence and recommendation systems, which are pivotal to e-commerce and many other industries in the economy. Investors who buy the stock at these lower share prices should earn a great return on their investment.

Share prices of Meta Platforms are down 50% over the last year as advertisers held back on spending in the face of uncertainty in the economy. Social media platforms have also had a difficult time navigating around the effects Apple's privacy changes on iOS have had on ad tracking. These headwinds contributed to a sluggish year of growth.

Despite revenue falling 4% year over year in the third quarter, engagement across Meta's family of apps is still strong. Meta's social media platforms now reach over 3.7 billion people every month. That is a massive pool of users that brands will want to connect with.

Meta is investing billions in AI to make its platform more valuable to those advertisers. This should create better content recommendations across its apps, which in turn will translate to higher ad spending and revenue.

The company's capital expenditures in the third quarter were more than double the same quarter in 2019, driven by increased spending on AI capacity.

"2 No-Brainer Stocks I'd Buy Right Now Without Hesitation
2023-01-27T10:25:00Z
The 2022 market correction was a wake-up call for investors that stocks can fall quite sharply. As frustrating as corrections and bear markets can be, it's worth remembering that the S&P 500 index is up 345% since the bottom of the 2008 market crash. The market can be extremely volatile sometimes, but these are the times when you want to be putting money to work in stocks.

To increase the odds of finding long-term winners, I like to focus on industry-leading companies that have major tailwinds behind them, such as trends where people are spending more time or certain technologies that companies are rapidly adopting.

Here are two stocks capitalizing on huge opportunities that are poised to outperform in the next bull market.

The video game industry offers investors attractive long-term returns, with Take-Two Interactive (TTWO -0.97%) being one of the standout performers in recent years. Take-Two is a leading maker of video games for Microsoft's Xbox, Sony's PlayStation, and PCs and mobile devices. From 2011 through 2021, the stock climbed 1,210%.

With the stock down 33% over the last 12 months, investors have a chance to own one of the top growth stocks in the industry at a better value.

The shift to a digital distribution strategy caused a windfall for leading game companies. Take-Two saw its profit margin increase from negative territory 10 years ago to over 15% at the end of 2021. The swell in profits sent the stock soaring and is giving management extra ammunition to invest in more growth.

The video game industry is expected to increase from $205 billion in 2020 to $282 billion by 2026, according to IDG Consulting. Take-Two has nearly doubled its development studio staff over the last four years. It currently has several titles scheduled for release over the next few years.

The recent acquisition of Zynga, the maker of Words with Friends and other popular titles on mobile, significantly expands Take-Two's development capabilities in the largest revenue segment of the video game industry. In the most recent earnings report, Take-Two reported mid-teens year-over-year growth in advertising bookings (a non-GAAP measure of revenue) on mobile -- a good showing in a slow economy that points to even higher growth when the market is stronger.

Considering future revenue from new releases and growth in Zynga's mobile business, Take-Two should be able to grow its bookings at a double-digit annualized rate over the next several years, based on management's forecast at the time of the acquisition. I believe investors who buy the stock today have a good chance of beating the market over the next five years.

Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) is the leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) used in gaming PCs and data centers. The stock delivered a 6,200% return over the last 10 years. The company successfully adapted its GPU technology used in consumer PCs for processing massive data workloads. This resulted in Nvidia's data center revenue increasing seven-fold over the last five years, and it's just getting started.

More companies are relying on artificial intelligence-powered analytics, voice chat, and recommendation systems. This is a strong tailwind that will push Nvidia through this turbulent economy toward more growth. These trends are expected to grow the GPU market at a compound annual rate of 33% through 2027, according to Mordor Intelligence.

However, gaming is still an important market for Nvidia, too. While the data center segment is now the company's largest business, Nvidia was generating over $3 billion in quarterly revenue a year ago in the gaming segment, where it probably also got a marginal boost from cryptocurrency mining. But the increasing realism of video games will only continue to attract more people to the hobby and fuel more demand, as it did over the last decade.

While Nvidia's gaming business experienced lower revenue over the last year due to macroeconomic headwinds, I wouldn't hesitate to buy the stock right now. A recovery in gaming is a catalyst for Nvidia. In fact, the stock is already up 30% year to date, as investors anticipate stabilization in the gaming business this year.

"2 Top AI Stocks Ready for a Bull Run
2023-02-19T16:00:00Z
Artificial intelligence has taken the market by storm this year.

The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT has opened investors' eyes to the potential for the new technology, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said that a new race has begun with generative AI tech.

AI stocks have become so buzzworthy that C3.ai, a software-as-a-service company focused on artificial intelligence, nearly doubled in January, and shares of Buzzfeed more than doubled in a single day after the company said it would use AI tools for some of its content.

While the hype around AI may be reaching a fever pitch, the technology does seem to be transformational, and there will likely be a number of winners. For now, the best move for investors looking to get exposure to AI seems to be with established mega-cap companies. Keep reading to see two stocks that fit the bill today.

Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META -0.96%) hasn't gotten as much attention in artificial intelligence as some other big tech stocks, but the company has been developing its AI capabilities for years.

For example, Meta uses AI in its discovery engine, which surfaces and recommends accounts and content for users on Facebook and Instagram to follow. Those AI tools are especially important in making Reels work, its short-term video product that competes with TikTok and relies on recommendations rather than follows.

It also uses AI to improve advertising conversions, saying that conversions improved by over 20% from a year ago, and artificial intelligence helps its engineers be more productive.

Meta is one of the few companies large enough to compete in AI areas like generative AI that will require multibillion-dollar investments. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Meta's recent earnings call that one of his goals for the company is to build it into a leader in generative AI.

Like Alphabet and other big tech stocks, Meta also has a number of AI experiments, including Galactica, the scientific research tool that it briefly released recently, and Cicero, an AI agent that can negotiate, persuade, and cooperate with people.

Finally, Meta stock is affordably priced at a price-to-earnings ratio of 19 based on this year's expected earnings. In other words, investors don't seem to be pricing in the potential impact of AI.

The artificial intelligence market is wide open, but one thing is clear: Running AI programs like ChatGPT takes tremendous computing power, and that will favor chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%), the company that invented the graphics processing unit, which is often used for artificial intelligence.

Nvidia announced in November that it was teaming up with Microsoft to build a massive cloud AI computer, a multiyear partnership that will take advantage of Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure and Nvidia's GPUs. The move should help ensure that Nvidia is a leader in making chips for AI applications.

According to analyst forecasts, demand for chips for ChatGPT and other generative AI tools is expected to add billions of dollars in revenue for Nvidia this year, and momentum could build as both Microsoft and Alphabet have announced their own chatbot tools. The industry seems poised to develop quickly, and Nvidia's strength in GPUs gives it a competitive advantage in the industry as it has the greatest expertise and range of chips.

Nvidia shares have surged this year, up 54% in part on optimism around the AI breakthrough, but the stock is still down substantially from its peak in 2021, indicating more upside potential, especially as the market for its products is expanding.

Like other chipmakers, Nvidia is suffering from the inventory glut in the industry, which has weighed on prices. Further, its gaming segment has been particularly weak as the pandemic tailwinds have faded. However, the next wave of AI has the potential to make Nvidia a big winner over the long run, especially given its competitive advantages in the sector."
"1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock You Can Confidently Pay a Premium For and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague
2023-02-22T10:06:00Z
Investing in the stock market isn't always peaches and cream, as 2022 showed. All three major U.S. indexes plunged into a bear market and produced their worst single-year returns since 2008.

But even amid a tumultuous environment for stocks, investors tend to find patches of inspiration. In 2023, that source of inspiration is anything that has to do with artificial intelligence (AI).

In its simplest form, AI involves using machines or systems to handle tasks that humans would normally be responsible for. What makes AI so special is the ability for software and machines to grow smarter and evolve over time. This machine-learning capability is what gives AI such broad applications.

It also doesn't hurt that AI is expected to be one of the fastest sustainably growing opportunities this decade. A recent report from Grand View Research estimates the global AI market will grow by an annualized rate of 37.3% between 2023 and 2030 to reach a cool $1.81 trillion by the turn of the decade.

With AI chatbot ChatGPT captivating the attention of innovation seekers and investors alike, the valuations of most AI stocks have soared in 2023. At the moment, there's one AI stock you can confidently pay a premium valuation for and not raise an eyebrow. Likewise, there's another pricey AI stock I'd suggest not touching with a 10-foot pole.

Despite what looks to be a U.S. recession on the horizon, you can confidently put your money to work in end-user cybersecurity stock CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD -0.14%). Even with CrowdStrike valued at a nosebleed multiple of 57 times Wall Street's consensus forward-year earnings, it brings well-defined competitive advantages to the table.

Before digging into company specifics, it's important to recognize that cybersecurity has evolved into a basic-necessity service over the past 20 years. No matter how poorly the U.S. economy and stock market perform, businesses of all sizes are going to continue to need cybersecurity solutions to protect their sensitive data. After all, hackers don't take time off just because Wall Street or the U.S. economy had a bad day.

CrowdStrike's biggest differentiating factor is Falcon, the company's cloud-native security platform. Falcon leans on AI and machine-learning to become more efficient over time at recognizing and responding to potential threats.

In a typical week, the company notes, Falcon will oversee trillions of events. Each of those events adds to its collective intelligence and makes the platform that much more secure for its more than 21,100 subscribers.

The testament to Falcon's efficacy can be seen in the company's steadily rising gross retention rate. It's no secret that CrowdStrike's software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions aren't the cheapest. Nevertheless, the company's gross retention rate has expanded from less than 94% to more than 98% in under six years. Subscribers are sticking with the company.

But the top reason you can confidently pay a premium for shares of CrowdStrike is the willingness of the company's existing subscribers to add on to their original purchase. Roughly six years ago, a single-digit percentage of CrowdStrike 450 customers had purchased four or more of its cloud-module subscriptions. As of its latest quarterly filing, 60% of its 21,146 customers had purchased at least five cloud-module subscriptions. Add-on sales have lifted CrowdStrike's adjusted subscription gross margin to between 78% and 79% over the past three fiscal years (78% through the first nine months of fiscal 2023).

With an adjusted subscription gross margin of nearly 80%, CrowdStrike's earnings growth has the ability to outpace revenue growth for the foreseeable future. That should help take the sting off of its lofty forward-year price-to-earnings ratio.

The pricey artificial intelligence stock to avoid like the plague: Nvidia

On the other end of the spectrum is an ultra-popular AI stock with a premium valuation that you'd be wise to avoid like the plague. I'm talking about semiconductor solutions company Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%), which is going for 50 times Wall Street's forecast earnings in fiscal 2024.

"Why AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor Stocks Followed Nvidia Higher Today
2023-02-23T19:49:52Z
Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) is getting much of the credit for the gains in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -2.19%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.08%) shares today. Nvidia's encouraging fourth-quarter report is sending its stock higher on Thursday, and since AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor are in the same business, they are likely catching the same tailwind.

But that's not the only reason AMD and TSMC shares were up 3.1% and 3.8%, respectively, as of 1:58 p.m. ET on an otherwise tepid day for the market. Also boosting these tickers is the chipmaking initiative started by last year's passage of the CHIPS and Science Act -- and in particular, comments by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on domestic chipmaking today.

Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings beat is the main reason the stock was rallying as much 15% as of midday on Thursday. And that made it easier for related stocks to move higher.

But the three companies aren't that closely related. Data center processors are the only real bright spot in Nvidia's fourth-quarter report, accounting for more than half of the top line, and the only business to show year-over-year growth last quarter. AMD does some business in data center processors, but it drives less than one-third of its sales. TSMC doesn't make any branded processors of its own, but instead manufactures other companies' tech.

Much of today's stock boost, therefore, can be attributed to the growing governmental support for the U.S. chipmaking industry.

On Wednesday, Raimondo said, ""What we're out to do here is to ensure that at the end of implementation, the United States of America is the only country in the world where every company capable of producing leading-edge chips will have a significant research and development and high-volume manufacturing presence in our country."" Today, she said much the same.

The CHIPS and Science Act is backed by $280 billion worth of funding, with $50 billion of that earmarked for Raimondo to hand out in support of research on chip design and manufacturing.

Government funding alone doesn't guarantee profitable growth for any company in the chipmaking business. Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC will still bear the bulk of the risk for establishing manufacturing within the United States.

But U.S. political and financial support for chipmaking self-sufficiency has arguably never been stronger. Given that domestic chip foundries ultimately solve several logistical challenges for the industry's top names -- and potential problems in the future -- Raimondo's comments should be considered bullish for all three of the aforementioned tickers."
"Don't Go Into the Next Bull Market Without These 3 Stocks
2023-02-10T15:00:00Z
Has the bear market finally given way to a new bull market? Maybe. Although stocks have only been choppy of late, we've seen a few flashes of bullish brilliance since October. It's certainly arguable that we're nearer the end of the bear market than not.

With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three stocks you might want to own at a new bull market's onset: United Rentals (URI 0.85%), Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%), and Ulta Beauty (ULTA -2.16%). These tickers were among the last bull market's biggest winners. And their respective company's products and services are always in demand during economic growth phases.

These stocks dished out quadruple-digit gains between 2009's low and 2021's high. While it may be tough to muster the same-sized gains again during the next bull market, there's little doubt all three companies have the right stuff to thrive once the global economy is booming again.

Let's look first at United Rentals. There was a time many years ago when companies debated purchasing equipment versus renting it when needed. The cost of buying equipment has outpaced inflation since then.

Yet, so has the availability of rentals. Both trends favor tool rental outfits like United Rentals, which offers short-term access to everything ranging from tile saws to scissor lifts to backhoes, and more. Assuming a new bull market coincides with economic growth and stabilizing interest rates that in turn spark a new housing boom, this company could sizzle in the years ahead.

Still, it wouldn't be a completely crazy idea to let United Rentals shares fall back from their recent record high just a bit if you're interested. It looks like most investors are seeing the same dynamic, pre-emptively buying the stock for what looks like a very bright future.

Technology is also always in demand, but some types of technology see especially high demand when times are good and corporate profits are strong. Nvidia makes a great deal of this tech. In fact, its graphic cards account for more than 80% of the world's graphic processor sales, according to John Peddie Research. Video gamers love them, and an ever-growing number of computer animation and design professionals do as well.

Nvidia's big breadwinner during the next bull market, however, won't be graphics processing units meant to generate a visual display for users. The company's next big growth engine is artificial intelligence. As it turns out, the same tech that makes great graphics cards also makes for great machine-learning equipment. That's why Nvidia's hardware is already found in the majority of the world's most powerful supercomputers, including the most powerful one owned and operated by Facebook parent Meta Platforms.

In light of this reach, Precedence Research's expectation that the AI hardware market is set for annualized growth of nearly 30% through 2030 bodes very well for Nvidia. A bull market will only bolster the stock's potential upside.

Finally, add Ulta Beauty to your list of the next bull market's potential mega-winners. It rallied more than 7,000% from its early 2009 low to 2021's high, and then somehow defied last year's bear market to now sit nearly 10,000% above the bottom made just 14 years ago.

Another gain like that is unlikely. But another market-beating advance is hardly out of the question. That's because the chain of more than 1,300 cosmetics, fragrance, and skincare stores is striking the perfect chord with consumers, offering a combination of affordability, accessibility, and connectivity. Although the company offers online shopping, the stores themselves are where most of the personal relationships with customers seem to be established and then maintained, with an assortment of more than 25,000 different products.

Other retailers may look similar. Ulta is differentiated, however, in the ways that matter most. Its value proposition means it can stand up to weak economies. When times are good, though, it can truly shine by catering to consumers' splurges.

"1 Nasdaq Stock That Could Supercharge Your Portfolio in 2023 and Beyond
2023-02-14T11:30:00Z
Investors have regained confidence in technology stocks once again in 2023 amid favorable economic data points such as cooling inflation and a resilient global economy. The International Monetary Fund raised its global growth forecast from 2.7% to 2.9%, and that's no doubt aided the Nasdaq Composite index's terrific rise of nearly 16% so far this year.

This impressive jump has rubbed off positively on Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%), with the stock shooting up over 51% in 2023. Investors owning this semiconductor stock in their portfolios may want to continue holding it because there's every reason to think it can sustain its hot rally. Let's look at why that may be the case.

Nvidia is sitting on notable catalysts that could mitigate gaming headwinds

Nvidia faces a major challenge in the form of weak personal computer (PC) sales that have crushed its gaming segment in recent quarters, but there are a few solid growth drivers that may help the chipmaker outpace the market's expectations in 2023.

The first reason Nvidia could deliver more upside this year is the data center business. This segment has been a bright spot for the company in difficult times, generating $11.4 billion in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 (which ended on Oct. 30, 2022). Its revenue has increased 55% during this period and has also accounted for a similar proportion of the company's top line.

So, the health of the data center business will be critical to Nvidia's growth in 2023. The good news for the company is that the increasing adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications -- which allow users to write complex essays, create images, and even get answers to questions -- should create more need for the data center chips that Nvidia sells.

Polaris Market Research estimates that the global generative AI market could clock annual growth of 34% through 2032 and generate annual revenue of $201 billion. Given that graphics cards play an important role in accelerating AI workloads in data centers, the rapid adoption of generative AI should unlock a solid opportunity for Nvidia to increase the sales of its data center chips.

It is also worth noting that the sales of data center graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to grow at an annual pace of over 22% through the end of the decade, according to Grand View Research. Investors shouldn't forget that Nvidia is the dominant player in the enterprise GPU market, with a 91% share, according to IDC, so it is in a prime position to tap the end-market opportunity. Also, the data center business is set to receive a new catalyst this year that may unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the chipmaker.

Another reason why Nvidia shares could sustain their positive momentum in 2023 is that the automotive segment has been stepping on the gas lately. Though still a small part of the company's overall business, automotive has the potential to move the needle in a significant way in the long run.

This segment has generated $609 million in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, an increase of 38% over the prior-year period. Its outstanding run seems set to continue thanks to a sizable pipeline of potential contracts and a massive addressable opportunity worth $300 billion.

Why it makes sense to remain invested in the stock

The growing influence of the data center business on Nvidia's top line and emerging catalysts such as the automotive segment and the omniverse could help it do better than what Wall Street is expecting from the company in 2023 and beyond.

Analysts are anticipating a 9% increase in Nvidia's top line in fiscal 2024 to $29.3 billion. That number is expected to jump impressively in the next fiscal year.

Also, Nvidia is forecast to clock 31% earnings growth in the current fiscal year to $4.29 per share and maintain that momentum over a five-year period as well, with an annual earnings growth rate of 21%. So, it would be prudent for existing Nvidia shareholders to continue holding the stock because it looks capable of delivering more upside. What's more, they may even consider adding to their positions if the stock dips in the near term on account of the weakness in the gaming business, as the growth drivers it is sitting on should lead to long-term gains

"Intel Just Sounded a Warning Bell. Here's What It Means for Nvidia and AMD Stocks.
2023-01-31T15:10:00Z
The economy has been the single biggest factor driving Wall Street over the past year with technology stocks taking the biggest beating. Investors have been watching financial reports closely for indications of where things might go from here and paying particular attention to what executives have to say about the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. So when Intel (INTC -1.83%) reported its earnings, management's commentary took on a whole new importance.

While the company's results were disappointing, it was what executives had to say about the future that turned heads. Management's comments suggest tough times lie ahead -- not only for Intel but for rivals Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.08%) as well.

Investors were expecting the challenging macroeconomic conditions to affect Intel's results, but things were worse than many anticipated. Fourth-quarter revenue of $14.0 billion fell 32% year over year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.10, which plunged 92%. To give those numbers context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $14.5 billion and EPS of $0.20, so Intel's results missed the mark by a wide margin.

Fueling the dismal results were challenges across Intel's largest segments. Revenue from the client computing group (PCs and laptops) slumped 36% year over year to $6.6 billion, while data center and artificial intelligence revenue fell 33% to $4.3 billion. The network and edge segment held up better but still edged 1% lower to $2.1 billion.

Yet as disappointing as the financial results were, it was Intel's outlook that spooked investors across the semiconductor industry.

Intel's outlook was the first shoe to drop. In the first quarter, management expects revenue to fall 40% to $11.0 billion at the midpoint of its guidance while swinging to an adjusted loss per share of $0.15, compared to EPS of $1.34 in the prior-year quarter.

The speed at which Intel's business fell off a cliff took the market by surprise, sending many Intel investors running for the exits. Perhaps more alarming, however, was when the second shoe dropped -- management's comments about what it expects from the economy in 2023.

Intel said it expects ""persistent economic headwinds through at least the first half of 2023."" While that part wasn't a surprise, comments from CEO Pat Gelsinger about the state of the data center market raised eyebrows (emphasis mine).

""We expect Q1 server consumption TAM [total addressable market] to decline both sequentially and year over year at an accelerated rate, with 2023's first-half server consumption TAM down year on year, before returning to growth in the second half,"" Gelsinger said on the earnings call.

While that's not the end of the world, it highlights the growing importance of the data center market to the semiconductor industry, and what it could mean for upcoming results.

Things could get ugly for Nvidia and AMD

To understand the implications for Nvidia, one need only review its recent results and the challenges. For the first nine months of fiscal 2023 (which started Jan. 31, 2022), the data center segment was responsible for 54% of Nvidia's total revenue, up from 39% in fiscal 2022.

Furthermore, in its fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 30, 2022), Nvidia's data center segment did all the heavy lifting as revenue grew 31% year over year to $3.8 billion. At the same time, gaming revenue -- which has historically represented the lion's share of Nvidia's sales -- plunged 51% to $1.6 billion. Overall, revenue of $5.9 billion tumbled 17%.

AMD's results have held up better so far this year, but the company is similarly dependent on its data center business. The segment represented 24% of its revenue during the first nine months of 2022, compared to 22% during the prior-year period.

While it's easy to see why Nvidia and AMD investors would be nervous, it's important to put this information in context. It was just May of last year that Nvidia and AMD each reported record quarterly sales with revenue growing 46% and 71%, respectively. The timing of their decelerating revenue growth coincides with the downturn in the macroeconomic environment. This suggests that Nvidia and AMD will get their groove back once the economy regains its footing.

"3 Red-Hot Stocks That Could Continue to Beat the Market
2023-02-09T11:05:00Z
Generally speaking, investors want to own a piece of companies with real growth prospects and proven staying power. If they do, stocks' prices will eventually take care of themselves. Conversely, chasing a hot stock simply because it's hot is rarely a great idea. When unsupported rallies take a turn for the worse, the turns can become mighty painful.

There are cases, however, where a red-hot stock rally really is an indication of the company's underlying strength. At the very least, these stocks are worth a closer look. Here's a rundown of three such recently hot prospects you might want to consider for your portfolio.

It would be easy to assume the worst of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) right now. Not only are the warning bells of a semiconductor supply crisis still ringing, but macroeconomic weakness tends to take an exaggerated toll on the technology sector. Revenue for its fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 30) dropped 17%, and the top line for its recently ended Q4 is projected to fall over 21%. Sales for the quarter currently underway are expected to slide even more.

And yet, the stock's up nearly 50% over the past month, and still steaming higher.

Why the discrepancy? Two things.

First, much of the recent rally is related to the overzealous selling seen in 2022. The market's just correcting its mistake. Second, investors are seeing the bigger picture, recognizing Nvidia's longer-term potential is incredible despite the current turbulence.

It's easy to overlook, but this company isn't just making graphics cards for video gamers anymore. Data center processors are its biggest business now, and most of its data center offerings are artificial intelligence (AI) computing platforms. That's a very resilient, high-growth arena. Precedence Research predicts the AI hardware market will grow at an average annualized pace of nearly 27% through 2030. Market research outfit Omdia estimates that around 80% of the world's artificial intelligence processors are already made by Nvidia, so it's clearly got the right stuff to help hold onto this dominant degree of market share.

It's curious. Consumers are seemingly losing interest in expensive fashion labels, while appreciation for value and quality is growing. Traffic at mall-based department stores also continues to wane as the world finds other, more cost-effective and efficient means of shopping. The shift seemingly works against luxury clothing and accessory specialists like Tapestry (TPR -1.18%), which owns brands such as Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman.

Yet it continues to persevere. While initially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, sales for the fiscal year ending in mid-2021 were up an impressive 16%. They grew the same amount for the next 12 months. Revenue is on pace to roll in a little below last year's top line for fiscal 2023 ending in June, but it is then predicted to accelerate again. Oh, and the company is increasingly profitable despite stiff inflation and a wobbly economy.

The explanation for this unlikely success is simple enough: This isn't your mother's (or your grandmother's) Coach and Kate Spade.

It's admittedly so subtle that it's difficult to see. This company, however, is truly connecting with consumers willing and able to spend a bit more than average for access to luxury. It does a significant amount of repair and refurbishment business, for instance, appealing to the buyer that's also worried about the fashion business's impact on the environment. At the same time, Tapestry's management understands its current core customers -- Gen-Z -- are looking to fashion as an expression of their individual style as much as they're looking for affordable luxury.

And yes, it all makes a difference. While Goldman Sachs concedes the average consumer is strapped right now, the investment bank's researchers suggest shoppers are more likely to spend less on basic goods like denim so they can continue to purchase higher-end handbags.

Finally, add SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG -1.88%) to your list of red-hot stocks that may not be slowing down anytime soon. Its shares notched a 46% gain in the past three months, including a 13% advance over just the past month.

"Why Cloudflare Stock Was Soaring on Thursday
2023-02-02T18:51:55Z
Shares of Cloudflare (NET -4.11%) were up by 16.3% as of 1:20 p.m. ET on Thursday following positive analyst comments from MoffettNathson regarding the company's exposure to opportunities in the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence.

Cloudflare's expansive server network already improves the performance and security of many popular websites, but MoffettNathson analyst Sterling Auty noted that the company has a huge opportunity in AI. It already handles the security for popular applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Apple's iCloud Private Relay service.

The stock fell hard last year as investors worried about macroeconomic headwinds and the possibility that companies would scale back their spending on cloud services. In addition, according to Auty, some investors might be nervous about the collapse in cryptocurrency prices and how that could impact Cloudflare, which counts some popular crypto exchanges among its clients.

Still, Cloudflare continued to report strong revenue growth last year. In Q3 -- its most recently reported quarter -- its top line rose by 47% year over year as it surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue.

AI is, indeed, a tailwind that investors should pay attention to over the long term. Two years ago, Cloudflare partnered with Nvidia to deploy graphics processing units (GPUs) to run AI-based applications on edge servers in the company's data centers around the world.

Overall, management believes its total addressable market will expand by 35% over the next few years to $135 billion as it continues to introduce new services for its network customers. The stock might look expensive based on its current price-to-sales ratio of 23, but the company's rate of growth and its opportunities to expand its service offerings could prove to be incredibly valuable over time."
"3 Surprising Stocks You Never Knew Warren Buffett Owns
2023-01-30T10:06:00Z
Since the mid-1960s, Warren Buffett has shown Wall Street that he knows a thing or two about investing. In the roughly 57 years he's spent as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.51%) (BRK.B 0.31%), the Oracle of Omaha, as he's come to be known, has created more than $685 billion in value for shareholders, as well as delivered an aggregate return for the company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 3,800,000%, through Jan. 25, 2023.

Buffett's ability to consistently outperform the S&P 500 has encouraged generations of investors to ride his coattails. Thanks to required quarterly 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, mirroring the Oracle of Omaha's buying and selling activity is relatively easy.

But you might be surprised to learn that Berkshire Hathaway's 13F doesn't tell the complete story.

Back in 1998, Buffett's company acquired General Re for $22 billion. While General Re's reinsurance operations were the prize of this buyout, it also owned a specialty investment firm called New England Asset Management (NEAM). When Berkshire Hathaway bought General Re, it also acquired NEAM.

As of the end of September, New England Asset Management had nearly $5.9 billion in assets under management and positions in 184 securities. Even though Warren Buffett doesn't guide NEAM's buying and selling activity as he does Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio, what New England Asset Management buys is, ultimately, owned by Buffett's company. You could say it's Buffett's own secret portfolio.

What follows are three surprising stocks you probably had no clue Warren Buffett technically owns.

The first shocker is that Warren Buffett's company is actually the owner of 15,154 shares of Walt Disney (DIS -1.41%), courtesy of New England Asset Management. Walt Disney is what I'd regard as Warren Buffett's biggest investing mistake.

In 1966, Warren Buffett and a consortium of investors purchased 5% of Disney, which equated to a $4 million investment. At the time, Disney was an up-and-coming theme-park operator with proprietary film content that didn't come close to matching its content library today. Buffett and his investors sold this 5% stake in Disney just one year later for a 50% return. Had Buffett and his consortium stuck around, this stake would be worth almost $9.9 billion today.

The interesting thing is that Warren Buffett owned shares of Walt Disney a second time -- and, once again, chose not to stick around all that long. When Disney acquired Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, which Berkshire Hathaway held a position in, Buffett's company came into possession of roughly 73.84 million split-adjusted shares of the ""House of Mouse."" These shares, which were sold by Buffett and his team between 1999 and 2000, would be worth approximately $8 billion today. Including dividends paid, the Oracle of Omaha missed out on more than $19 billion in gains.

But thanks to NEAM, Warren Buffett indirectly has a chance to redeem himself.

Walt Disney's most exciting growth driver at the moment looks to be its streaming operations. In less than three years following its launch, Disney+ amassed more than 164 million subscribers, which demonstrates the lure of the Disney brand. If CEO Bob Iger is successful at increasing prices for Disney's streaming platforms while being mindful of expenses, profitability for this segment shouldn't be too far off.

A second stock you'll be jaw-dropped to find as a holding by Warren Buffett's company is gold miner Newmont (NEM -1.63%). New England Asset Management held 37,328 shares of Newmont as of the end of the third quarter.

To not beat around the bush, the Oracle of Omaha dislikes gold as an investment. According to Buffett:

As you can gather, Buffett is a fan of businesses that produce ongoing utility and value. Whether it's utilities that provide electricity, oil companies that fuel your car, food and beverage businesses that fill your belly, or banks that create pathways for homeownership, the Oracle of Omaha only invests in businesses that can continually provide utility.

"A Bull Market Is Coming: 5 Killer Growth Stocks I Just Bought
2023-02-12T11:55:00Z
The past year was tough for investors. 2022 was marked by historically high inflation, rising interest rates, and the worst market downturn in over a decade. Each of the three major market indexes fell into bear market territory last year, and even the best growth stocks weren't spared. In fact, some of the best-performing stocks of the past several years were hit hardest, as investors began avoiding companies with high valuations, a lack of profits, or both.

If there's a silver lining to the otherwise cloudy outlook, it's this: Every bear market eventually gives way to an even more robust bull market. Investors able to look past the current uncertainty and buy stocks at historically low prices will be winners in the rising market to come.

With that as a backdrop, I'm putting my money where my mouth is. Let's look at five fabulous growth stocks I added to my own portfolio this month.

There's no denying Nvidia's (NVDA -1.60%) growth stock bona fides. Over the past 10 years, the stock has soared more than 7,200%, driven by revenue that surged more than 500%. The company is the undisputed leader in the discrete desktop graphics processing unit (GPU) market. Furthermore, its data center and cloud computing customer list is a veritable Who's Who of tech glitterati.

Its credentials didn't stop Nvidia stock from plummeting as much as 66% off its peak reached in late 2021, but the evidence suggests a robust rebound is in the cards.

As recently as its fiscal 2023 first quarter (ended May 1, 2022), Nvidia was posting record quarterly revenue that grew 46% to $8.29 billion, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.36 grew 49%. In the two quarters since -- and in the face of rising economic uncertainty -- customers and businesses alike rightly reined in spending.

Its recent record results show that the semiconductor maker was firing on all cylinders, and the broader economy is responsible for its decline. Experienced investors know that this too shall pass. When the bull market starts to run -- and it will -- so too will Nvidia. In fact, that may have already begun: Nvidia's stock price has doubled since October.

The ongoing digital transformation and rapid adoption of cloud computing created an optimum environment for Snowflake (SNOW -3.06%), which debuted publicly in late 2020 after years in stealth mode. The company's cloud-based data storage, data lake, and data analytics services caught the eyes of several high-profile investors, including Berkshire Hathaway and Salesforce.

Snowflake stock doubled on its first day of trading, and had tripled by the following year, before economic upheaval sent the stock price crashing down as much as 70% from its peak. But don't confuse stock price with performance.

Even as many companies struggled in the face of the downturn, Snowflake has thrived. In its fiscal third quarter 2023 (which ended Oct. 31, 2022), revenue grew 67% year over year, sending adjusted EPS surging 200%. The results were powered by the company's pricing structure. Snowflake doesn't charge a subscription fee for those using its software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform, but rather relies on use-based pricing -- which wins rave reviews from customers.

Customer metrics were equally robust, growing 34% year over year, while the number of customers spending $1 million annually surged 94%. Existing customers tend to spend more as time goes on, as evidenced by its net revenue retention rate of 165%.

Snowflake stock continues to be volatile, but it's risen 36% from its trough last year. However, given its history of outperformance, the stock has much further to rise.

While marketing once evoked images of smoke-filled back rooms and martini lunches, The Trade Desk (TTD -2.28%) isn't your grandfather's ad tech company. The disruptive upstart has seen its stock rise 1,590% since its debut in 2016 -- even after its recent bear market slump.

CEO Jeff Green revolutionized the industry when he created the first online ad trading platform in 2004. He brought that same sense of disruption to The Trade Desk when it debuted in 2009, and advertising has never been the same. The company's cutting-edge platform lets ad buyers get the most bang for their buck with real-time bidding for ad inventory.

"These 3 Tech Stocks Are Building the Future
2023-02-09T11:00:00Z
When investing in the stock market, choosing companies with solid market share in consistently growing industries is always best. The tech market is home to a wealth of growth stocks because it's made up of companies in a near-constant state of development and innovation. And investing in companies that have a perpetual eye on the future can provide significant gains over the long term.

Here are three tech stocks building the future, making them excellent investments for the long haul.

Nvidia's (NVDA -1.60%) stock plummeted 53% in 2022, alongside a declining PC market. However, its shares have climbed 51% since Jan. 1 as Wall Street has grown bullish over the company's prospects in artificial intelligence.

According to Grand View Research, the AI market was worth $136.55 billion in 2022 and will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37.3% through 2030. Meanwhile, Nvidia is home to technology crucial to the market's growth. The tech company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have the processing power necessary to push AI forward.

Moreover, in November 2022, Nvidia partnered with Microsoft's (MSFT -2.18%) Azure to build a massive cloud AI computer. The partnership will combine Nvidia's GPUs with Azure software, which will ""help enterprises train, deploy, and scale AI,"" the company said in a news release.

AI will likely impact the future development of countless forms of technology, such as search engines, self-driving vehicles, machine learning, and much more. And Nvidia is well positioned to be a major player in that development.

Microsoft owes much of its success to its near-constant search for technologies of the future. Since its founding almost 50 years ago, it has become a leader in operating systems, productivity software, video games, and cloud computing with this mindset. For instance, the launch of Microsoft's cloud computing service Azure in 2010 has more than paid off, with the platform still reporting double-digit quarterly revenue in 2023.

Most recently, Microsoft's $1 billion investment in AI start-up OpenAI in 2019 is looking like one of its best decisions of the decade. The AI company stunned the tech world in November with the launch of its chatbot software ChatGPT, capable of producing human-like dialogue based on prompts. The software will soon be offered through Azure and is expected to incorporate Microsoft's search engine Bing in the future.

The promise of ChatGPT has led to reports that Microsoft is considering a further investment of $10 billion in OpenAI. Meanwhile, competitors like Alphabet have announced a stronger focus on AI going forward, as ChatGPT has created a threat to its Google search engine.

Microsoft is easily an investment in the future, with its stock likely to offer consistent gains for years.

While Apple (AAPL -1.80%) isn't always the first to the plate when it comes to new technology, the company is often credited with propelling it into mainstream use. The tech giant's immense success with smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and Bluetooth headphones has seen it take budding technology and put it into the hands of millions of users worldwide after launching its custom versions. In fact, AppleInsider reported in November 2019 that Apple's AirPods business would be a $175 billion enterprise on its own, making it the U.S.'s 32nd-largest company.

Additionally, numerous reports over the years have stated Apple intends to enter new markets such as virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), self-driving cars, and folding phones. Each of these technologies has long been in development by other companies, but Apple's immense brand loyalty and innovation could push them forward faster than would otherwise happen.

This year, Apple is expected to launch its first mixed-reality headset, which is expected to feature AR and VR capabilities. While Meta Platforms and Sony already have competing VR headsets on the market, Apple's device will likely push more consumers to consider applying the technology to their daily lives, attracting other companies to develop AR and VR software as demand rises.

"Why Apple, Corsair Gaming, and Alphabet Are No-Brainer Buys Right Now
2023-02-14T16:00:00Z
Since the start of 2023, many stocks have gradually risen, with the Nasdaq Composite index up roughly 14% year to date. The improvement has come as inflation is showing signs of easing and investors are optimistic about the prospects of a new year.

After the index plunged 33% in 2022, the potential start of a recovery could mean now is the perfect time to add some new stocks to your portfolio.

Here's why Apple (AAPL -1.80%), Corsair Gaming (CRSR -2.33%), and Alphabet (GOOG -1.89%) (GOOGL -1.94%) are no-brainer buys right now.

Apple didn't become the world's most valuable company with a market cap of $2.9 trillion by accident. It did so by consistently offering high-quality products presented in an interconnected ecosystem that is both consumer-friendly and difficult to abandon for competing devices.

The company's winning strategy has helped its stock rise 274% over the last five years and 822% over the last decade. Meanwhile, Apple's revenue has increased by 48% to $394 billion since 2018, and operating income has grown 68% to $119 billion in the same period.

With reliable long-term growth, it's not surprising the iPhone maker is Berkshire Hathaway's biggest holding. Apple is responsible for 39.6% of the company's portfolio and has made significant gains since Warren Buffett's company added the stock in 2016.

Over the next few years, Apple has some exciting projects reportedly in development, such as a mixed-reality headset. It's also continuing to grow its booming services business, and opting to create more in-house components in its iPhone. As a result, now is a great time to invest in Apple's stock.

As a leader in gaming PC accessories such as keyboards, mice, headsets, cases, and more, Corsair Gaming had a challenging 2022. The company's stock plummeted 35% last year as demand in the PC market slowed. However, Corsair shares have risen 30% since Jan. 1 in large part thanks to a promising earnings release.

On Feb. 9, Corsair reported its Q4 2022 results, in which revenue of $398.73 million beat analysts' estimates by $20.2 million. While revenue was down 22% year over year, the better-than-expected figure cheered investors. CEO Andy Paul attributed the positive results to boosted holiday sales from recent product launches by Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.

The PC market was hit hard by macroeconomic headwinds in 2022, with worldwide shipments for graphics processing units (GPUs) falling by 42%. However, Corsair's quarterly report could be a sign that the market is improving.

Nvidia and AMD are currently in the process of releasing their new lineups of GPUs, which are customarily staggered over two years. Market leader Nvidia debuted its most powerful new GPUs in 2022 and is expected to launch its mid- and low-tier cards, the most consumer-friendly and often best-selling, within 2023 and 2024. The same is also true of AMD. As Corsair sales often follow the GPU market, the company could benefit as PC owners upgrade their components.

It might feel risky to invest in a PC-dependent stock like Corsair after the market struggled last year. However, according to AP News, inflation eased for the sixth month in a row in December by 6.5%. That improvement, coupled with the launch of lower-priced GPUs, could create all the difference for Corsair, making its stock a no-brainer buy right now.

Alphabet shares sunk roughly 39% in 2022 because its advertising-dependent business was hurt by an economically challenging environment, which led many companies to slash budgets. However, Alphabet remains home to potent brands such as Android, YouTube, Fitbit, and the many Google services, which will likely keep it expanding for decades. Given the company's shares are still down 29% year over year, there's a compelling opportunity to buy this growth stock for a bargain.

While most of Alphabet's income is tied to advertising, it has a promising future in two burgeoning markets: cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI).

In Alphabet's fiscal 2022, its Google Cloud segment reported revenue growth of 37%, hitting $26.2 billion. The cloud computing platform achieved an 11% market share in Q3 2022, the third largest after Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure.

"The Top Stocks to Buy With $700 Right Now
2023-02-17T11:17:00Z
Owning stocks is fun again! After 2022, some people might have questioned whether the stock market was a good way to grow wealth -- or shrink it.

However, enthusiasm has returned with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average up 6%, 13%, and 2%, year to date, respectively.

So what stocks should investors buy if they have some extra cash? Here are my three picks for those with $700.

The first stock I would buy with $700 right now is Airbnb (ABNB -2.18%).

The company operates one of the world's best-known travel booking platforms, connecting travelers with hosts in more than 220 countries. With over 4 million hosts, Airbnb can offer travelers an almost limitless array of locations and homes.

What's more, the company is finally hitting its stride financially after the COVID-19 pandemic posed a severe threat to its business model. Key metrics are on the rise.

Consider these highlights from Airbnb's dazzling fourth-quarter earnings results released just days ago:
• None Nights and experiences booked grew 20% year over year to 88.2 million.
• None Gross booking value also rose 20% to 13.5 billion.

In addition, the company continues to see robust demand for long-term stays. Airbnb noted that 21% of total gross nights booked are for stays lasting longer than 28 days.

With its large base of host properties, Airbnb is set to capitalize on the world's insatiable desire to travel -- and that's why it's my first pick.

The second stock worth buying right now is the hottest automaker on the planet: Tesla (TSLA -2.57%).

Tesla CEO Elon Musk's biggest ambition might be getting humanity to Mars, but perhaps his second is replacing the internal combustion engine. And on that front, Musk is making exceptional progress.

Of course, Musk isn't the first visionary to attempt to replace gas guzzlers with electric vehicles (EV). Many have tried over the years, but Tesla seems like the first company with a genuine shot at success. However, three main obstacles have always stood in the way of EVs in the past: production, demand, and cost.

Yet Tesla has overcome these challenges through innovation (and, to be fair, a healthy dose of government subsidies in the case of cost).

The company surpassed 1.3 million vehicles produced in 2022 and now boasts factories in Shanghai, Germany, Texas, and California. Moreover, the first deliveries of its Cybertruck pickup are expected by the end of 2023. The exact number of Cybertruck pre-orders is unknown, but analysts estimate it is over 1.5 million.

That's great news for the company, as it demonstrates that even as more and more Teslas hit the road, there's still unmet demand for its new models. That's one more reason Tesla is a name worth owning now and for years to come.

My third and final pick is Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%). The maker of graphics and mobile processors is one of the world's leading semiconductor businesses and has branched out from its gaming roots.

The company serves four key markets: gaming, data center, professional visualization, and automotive.

As the rise of ChatGPT has shown, the public is eager to embrace artificial intelligence along with the productivity, innovation, and entertainment it aims to provide. However, cutting-edge AI requires massive computing power, which can only come from advanced semiconductors -- like the ones produced by Nvidia.

Granted, there are risks for the company. The first is that its gaming segment delivers 46% of its revenue -- and the gaming market is currently in the dumps. However, in the long term, gaming cyclicality is a small part of the story. The much larger one is the rise of AI, and how Nvidia stands to benefit from it.

We're still in the early innings when it comes to AI. And as developers create new and exciting tools, the hardware behind the cool gadgets and apps will have to keep up. With its proven ability to innovate and deliver, Nvidia is a name worth owning as the AI revolution continues to gain steam."
"3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy Right Now
2023-02-10T22:00:00Z
The metaverse may feel far off, but investors may want to pay close attention to what some of the world's leading technology companies are doing in this space. That's because the metaverse will be worth an estimated $679 billion by 2030.

Amazon (AMZN -2.42%), Apple (AAPL -1.80%), and Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) are poised to benefit from it as it grows. Here's why buying these companies now could give you great exposure to the coming metaverse.

Amazon may seem like an odd choice on this list, but the virtual worlds will require lots of cloud computing power, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) has it in spades.

The company has the largest cloud computing market share, with about 34% right now, giving it a firm lead over its closest rival, Microsoft, which holds 21% of the market.

AWS has become a juggernaut of a business for Amazon, with revenue reaching $80 billion in 2022, up 29% from the previous year. Even better news for Amazon investors is the fact that AWS is highly profitable. The cloud segment had $22.8 billion in operating income for the full year.

As the metaverse grows, Amazon's leading position in the cloud could grow right along with it. And with AWS being a profitable powerhouse for the company, investors will want to keep a close eye on this space.

Apple is best known for its iPhones, but the company is looking beyond smartphones for its next big thing. Rumors have been swirling for a while that Apple is on the cusp of debuting a mixed-reality headset (augmented reality and virtual reality), and Bloomberg said recently that the device would likely debut this year.

This matters because Apple has a long history of entering new markets and creating demand for them, and no other company has arguably had the same success in pairing hardware and software together to create a winning product.

The metaverse could end up being a significant market worth waiting on for Apple investors. Counterpoint Research estimates that AR/VR headset sales could surpass 100 million headsets in 2025, up from 50 million this year.

Additionally, Apple could be a huge winner in the metaverse app space as well. The company has proven that it knows how to grow its services business, which includes sales through its App Store, with revenue in the segment reaching an all-time high of $20.8 billion.

Any new Apple headset will be paired with an online store with metaverse apps, giving the company even more opportunity to grow its services segment.

Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has called the metaverse the ""next evolution of the internet,"" and the company is poised to benefit from it with its popular graphics processing units (GPUs). The company's chips are already a go-to choice in the gaming industry, making them an obvious choice for metaverse hardware as well.

Nvidia has already set up a platform for helping developers to create and operate their metaverse applications, and its GPUs will likely play a big role in metaverse cloud computing as well.

Nvidia's GPUs are used in high-powered data centers for tasks, including artificial intelligence processing, and as the metaverse grows, it is going to need plenty of these high-end data centers to keep it running smoothly.

Nvidia's data center segment sales increased 30% in the most recent quarter to $3.8 billion, and the company believes there's plenty more growth ahead. Huang believes that the metaverse will be a ""new economy"" that could surpass the size of the current economy. While that seems a bit overly optimistic, it's clear Nvidia's management is very bullish on the future of the metaverse.

Be patient with this space

Like any brand-new technology that's just getting started, it's going to take the metaverse a little while to find its footing. But investors who are looking to benefit from the potential growth of the metaverse over the next few years should give Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia strong consideration.

These companies are already making significant moves into this space and could prove to have an early start among their competitors

"3 Growth Stocks That Have Delivered 10X Returns Over the Past Decade
2023-02-14T15:11:54Z
Most retail investors get into the market with the intention of growing their investments. How they go about it and what level of risk they are willing to accept are the main differentiators for what kind of investor they end up being.

History has shown that investing in growth stocks can lead to much more significant returns for a portfolio than dividend stocks. Income-generating investments are good for risk-averse investors, but these types of businesses may not be reinvesting all that much into their future growth and long-term opportunities.

Three growth stocks that have generated some incredible returns for investors over the years are Insulet (PODD -1.08%), Netflix (NFLX -2.01%), and Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%). Here's a look at why these companies have been good buys in the past and some insight into whether they remain solid investments today.

Insulet makes the Omnipod, an insulin pump that helps people with diabetes manage their glucose levels. With rising cases of diabetes over the years, it's not all that surprising that the company has benefited from significant growth. In 10 years, the stock has risen a staggering 1,220%, eclipsing the S&P 500 and its more modest gains of 169% during that stretch.

Diabetes isn't going away anytime soon, and neither is the demand for insulin pumps. Analysts from Grand View Research project that by 2028, the global insulin pump market will be worth $8.3 billion (up from $4.6 billion in 2021), growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 8.7% until then.

For growth-oriented investors, that means there's still potential for the stock to rise even higher. Although Insulet's price-to-earnings ratio, which is over 1,000, may scare off investors, the company's high gross profit margin of 64% should enable Insulet to strengthen its bottom line as its growth continues. In 2021, the company's revenue came in at just under $1.1 billion, which is an impressive 49% higher than the $738 million it reported just two years earlier.

Insulet is a growing business that I could see getting much bigger in the future, which is why it isn't too late to buy the stock right now.

Streaming giant Netflix shouldn't be a surprise on this list. The company made a significant transformation over the years, from shipping DVDs to offering content online and making its own TV shows and movies. The stock even outperformed Insulet, posting gains of 1,260% over the past decade.

The company struggled last year amid a decline in subscriber numbers. But in its latest quarter (for the last three months of 2022), it added 7.7 million subscribers, bringing its total count to just under 231 million. And the company is looking at cracking down on password sharing as a way to potentially help increase subscriber count and revenue in the future. Revenue of $7.9 billion last quarter was up a modest 1.9% from the prior-year period. That growth rate will need to improve for Netflix to remain a strong buy in the years ahead.

Netflix stock is down from its highs, and while it could net investors a decent return, it faces a challenging road ahead. More companies are focusing on streaming content, making it a much more competitive landscape for the business. So while Netflix did well over the past decade, I'm not confident it can get anywhere close to delivering the same types of returns over the next 10 years.

I would hold off on buying the stock until the business can improve on its growth rate. At 35 times earnings, Netflix is the cheapest stock on this list, but that isn't enough of a reason to buy it given the challenges it is facing today.

Chipmaker Nvidia has benefited from strong growth over the years due to more digitalization of products and seemingly everything nowadays having a microchip. The issue became so bad that there is now a worldwide chip shortage, although some analysts are optimistic that the imbalance may be coming to an end soon, potentially easing up this year.

As a result of that boom, the stock generated incredible returns totaling 6,840% over the past 10 years -- vastly outperforming Netflix and Insulet, which have already proven to be great buys during that period. From $4 billion in sales at the end of fiscal 2012 (its year ends in January) to nearly $27 billion in fiscal 2022, Nvidia's growth is extremely impressive.

"A Bull Market Is Coming: 1 Perfect Index Fund to Buy in 2023 and Hold Forever
2023-02-04T11:15:00Z
S&P Global is a financial company best known as the creator of the S&P 500 index, which is widely regarded as a benchmark for the entire U.S. stock market due to its diverse nature. Last year, economic uncertainty arising from red-hot inflation and rising interest rates caused the S&P 500 to fall into a bear market, and the index is still 15% off its high.

Not surprisingly, many growth stocks have fallen even more sharply, simply because growth stocks are usually valued based on future revenue and free cash flow, and those metrics tend to look quite grim during periods of economic hardship. As a result, the S&P 500 Growth index -- another product curated by S&P Global -- is currently 27% off its high.

However, investors should be aware of two things: First, the S&P 500 has suffered dozens of bear markets in the past, but the index has always recouped its losses during the next bull market. Second, while growth stocks have sharply over the past year, the S&P 500 Growth index has still outperformed the S&P 500 over the past one, two, and three decades.

With that in mind, here is one index fund to buy now and hold forever.

Buy all the growth stocks in the S&P 500

The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG -1.25%) tracks the S&P 500 Growth index, meaning it provides exposure to all of the growth stocks in the S&P 500. Specifically, the Vanguard ETF measures the performance of 230 stocks that span all 11 market sectors, though the technology and healthcare sectors account for more than half of its weight.

The top 10 holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF are listed below.

The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF comes with one big advantage over individual stocks: It allows investors to instantly build a relatively diversified portfolio that requires very little oversight. As a caveat, the S&P 500 Growth index is less diverse than the broader S&P 500, simply because it excludes value stocks. That means the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF is prone to greater volatility than an S&P 500 index fund, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).

However, volatility works both ways. The tech-heavy composition of the S&P 500 Growth index has been the driving force behind its long-term outperformance. While the broad-based S&P 500 is up 169% over the past decade, the S&P 500 Growth index is up 212%, meaning it produced an annualized return of 12% over the last 10 years.

Assuming the same rate of return, $100 invested weekly in the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF would be worth about $91,200 in one decade, $374,600 in two decades, and $1.2 million in three decades. That said, expecting 12% annually over a 30-year time period is probably a bit optimistic, but the S&P 500 Growth index has undeniably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10-, 20-, and 30-year periods, so investors can reasonably assume growth stocks will continue to outperform in the long run. That makes the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF a particularly attractive option for risk-tolerant investors."
"Mobileye Was Intel's Star Segment in 2022, but Is Mobileye Stock a Buy?
2023-02-02T10:36:00Z
Share prices of Mobileye Global (MBLY -8.59%) are on a tear since they made their debut (again) late in 2022. Parent company Intel (INTC -1.83%) spun off some of its stake in the autonomous vehicle chip designer into a publicly traded company to raise much-needed cash last year, but it said it still owns 94% of the company.

Intel's own tires have been blown out, and there's no immediate relief in sight. Mobileye, meanwhile, was a standout performer for Intel in 2022. With some shares freed from Intel and available for purchase, is Mobileye a worthy investment for 2023 and beyond?

Before addressing Mobileye's business directly, we need some chip industry backstory. The semiconductor industry is presently dealing with a slump in sales emanating from a severe dropoff in consumer electronic sales (particularly PCs and laptops). While the market for data center and other enterprise chips is still strong, Intel is in especially sore straits as it has fallen far behind its competitors. It's forecasting a 40% year-over-year decline in revenue to kick off 2023, and it will operate at a steep loss even though that 40% decline should still equate to about $11 billion in quarterly sales.

The majority of Intel's business is seeing yellow flag warnings, but Mobileye is seeing nothing but green. Revenue in 2022 was up 35% to $1.87 billion -- including a 59% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter to $565 million.

Automotive chips are still zipping along at a fast clip. The chip shortage brought on by the pandemic is finally easing for most markets, but automotive semiconductor manufacturers are reporting they are still fully booked through the rest of 2023 and into 2024. Consumer spending is beginning to wane and could impact auto sales this year, especially if a recession strikes. However, new automotive technology like electric drivetrains and advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) are rapidly increasing the amount of silicon needed per vehicle.

In other words, not even a recession may be enough to knock Mobileye off course. The company is forecasting revenue to be in a range of $2.19 billion to $2.28 billion in 2023, up 20% from 2022 at the midpoint of guidance.

The present situation and the long-term secular growth trend influencing the automotive market bode well for Mobileye. But investors, just like those in the market for a new car, have choices here. Mobileye's chips for ADAS and the accompanying software have competition from Qualcomm's fast-growing auto supply segment (up 41% in fiscal 2022 to $1.37 billion). Nvidia not only has an automotive segment, but it also supplies data center hardware on which modern vehicle software is developed and perfected. Nvidia's auto unit revenue (excluding auto technology data center sales) rose 25% over the last 12-month stretch to $734 million.

Chip designers need to remain on the offensive and pour research and development dollars into their chip lineup to remain in pole position, and that's clearly creating some profit margin issues at Mobileye.

The company outperformed expectations in Q4 and generated GAAP net income, as well as positive free cash flow of $435 million in full-year 2022. However, embedded in 2023 guidance was a call for full-year GAAP operating losses of as much as $160 million, though free cash flow is likely to remain healthy and positive once backing out noncash expenses like amortization and employee stock compensation.

Shares trade for nearly 50 times expected adjusted operating profit based on the midpoint of $600 million Mobileye management predicts for 2023. It's not a cheap stock.

But then again, Mobileye thinks it can keep racing ahead at a brisk pace. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January 2023, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua said his company has a $17 billion ADAS sales pipeline through 2023 and an additional $3.5 billion from various software-based mobility services.

It can be dangerous counting victories before actually crossing the finish line, but clearly, Mobileye trades for a premium valuation for a reason. I'm staying cautious for now given economic uncertainty heading into 2023, but I've also been wrong about Mobileye since its IPO late in 2022. If you are eyeing the very long term (through 2023) and don't mind some wild swings in stock price, Mobileye very well might be the stock for you right now

"These 2 Nasdaq Stocks Are Beating the Market in 2023
2023-02-15T12:55:00Z
After a crushing year for the markets, there are a lot of good deals for the taking. PayPal Holdings (PYPL -2.18%) and Corsair Gaming (CRSR -2.33%) were beaten down last year for slowing growth, but after reporting better-than-expected financial results for the fourth quarter, these stocks are outpacing the broader market.

PayPal and Corsair Gaming are up 11% and 30%, respectively, year to date, easily outpacing the 8% return of the S&P 500 index. The good news is that these stocks are still trading at conservative valuations. Let's look at what's driving these companies' solid performance right now, so you can decide if they are right for your portfolio.

PayPal has 435 million customer accounts on its platform. Lower retail spending and reduced e-commerce growth were major headwinds for the company's revenue last year. But e-commerce isn't done growing by a long shot -- eMarketer estimates e-commerce sales to reach over $7 trillion in the next few years.

While growth hit a speed bump last year, the company focused on driving higher user engagement with its payment apps to gain market share at checkout. Despite increasing competition, its digital wallet is still the most widely accepted. In North America, 79% of retailers accept PayPal, up from 76% in 2021, according to Digital Commerce 360.

Moreover, tighter control of non-transaction-related expenses allowed more revenue from transaction fees to drop to the bottom line. The company's adjusted operating profit margin improved nearly 3 percentage points, which drove an 11% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the fourth quarter, outpacing the 9% increase in revenue on a currency-neutral basis.

Over the last three years, PayPal has continued to increase its customer accounts and transaction volumes, which has raised revenue by nearly 50%.

PayPal is seeing strong growth from its buy now, pay later service. The number of customers using this feature more than doubled last year.

PayPal has created a Swiss Army knife of a mobile app that offers just about everything from bill paying to personalized deals from merchants. This positions the company for more growth when e-commerce picks up again.

Even after the 13% return year to date, the stock is still trading at a conservative price-to-earnings ratio of 16. That looks too low, considering management's guidance that calls for adjusted EPS to increase approximately 18% over 2022.

That implies more operating leverage in the company's non-transaction-related expenses. Improving profitability makes this top digital payment stock a great buy.

Over 1.7 billion people are casual PC gamers, according to Statista, and about a tenth of those are regular players. This growing market is a huge opportunity for Corsair Gaming, one of the leading brands of computer peripherals.

Corsair grew revenue about 25% per year in the four years leading up to 2021. It experienced strong demand through the pandemic, with players buying up new gear to play games at home. But as the economy reopened and inflation picked up last year, the business stalled.

Demand is starting to return after a sluggish year. In the fourth quarter, revenue grew 27% over the previous quarter. Demand for gaming accessories was strong following new chip hardware releases in the fourth quarter from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.

Corsair also sells power supplies and memory chips that players usually buy when they upgrade their chip hardware, so strong demand for the latest processors can be catalysts for sales of keyboards and gaming controls. Graphics cards are becoming more plentiful at retail after a year of severe shortages, and that is playing into Corsair's hands.

Moreover, a strong slate of new game releases this year should drive demand for hardware and accessories. On that note, Wall Street analysts currently expect Corsair to report revenue growth of 7% in 2023, which is consistent with management's guidance. Analysts also forecast adjusted EPS improving to $0.64 this year, up from $0.18 in 2022.

"Here's Why Intel Stock Plunged Today
2023-01-27T22:04:00Z
Shares of Intel (INTC -1.83%) sank more than 6% on Friday after the chipmaker issued a dismal financial forecast for the year ahead.

Intel's revenue plummeted 32% year over year to $14 billion in the fourth quarter. A steep decline in the personal computer (PC) market weighed heavily on the semiconductor giant's results. A slowdown in the server market also took a toll.

Intel is slashing expenses to better withstand the downturn. The company is reducing its workforce and curtailing spending as it seeks to reduce costs by $3 billion in 2023 and as much as $10 billion by the end of 2025.

Still, Intel's profitability has declined precipitously over the past year. Its adjusted gross margin decreased by more than 12 percentage points to 43.8%. Intel's adjusted net income, in turn, dropped 92% to $394 million, or $0.10 per share.

Those results were far worse than Wall Street anticipated. Analysts had expected Intel to report per-share earnings of $0.20.

Intel sees more hard times ahead. Management forecast revenue to fall to between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion in the first quarter. The company also expects to report an adjusted loss of $0.15 per share.

Intel's concerning outlook provides further evidence that its challenges extend beyond the current weakness in its core markets. The lumbering chip giant has been losing market share to more innovative rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia in recent years. Intel's projected sales shortfall suggests this worrisome trend is likely to persist in 2023."
"Warren Buffett's Secret Portfolio Owns 3 Brand-Name AI Stocks
2023-02-13T10:06:00Z
For nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.51%) (BRK.B 0.31%) CEO Warren Buffett has been nothing short of a money machine for his shareholders. The Oracle of Omaha, as he's come to be known, has practically doubled up the average annual total return of the S&P 500 since 1964. In aggregate, Buffett has led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to a return of 3,781,451%, as of the closing bell on Feb. 8, 2023.

Warren Buffett's formula for success is pretty straightforward. He typically buys brand-name, profitable businesses that consumers trust, and he allows his investment thesis to play out over many years, if not decades. By focusing on cyclical companies in the financial and consumer staples sectors, he's been able to deliver steady returns for Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders.

But what if I told you that a small portion of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets were tied up in the hottest growth trend at the moment? Yes, I'm talking about artificial intelligence (AI).

In its simplest form, AI uses machines and systems to handle tasks humans would normally take care of. These machines and systems are capable of adapting and growing smarter over time, just like humans, which is what gives AI such promise and broad application.

Although estimates vary wildly given the relatively nascent nature of this technology, AI could be one of the fastest-growing trends of the decade. According to a report from Grand View Research, the global AI market is expected to grow by a compound annual rate of 37.3% between 2023 and 2030, and ultimately reach $1.81 trillion.

If you're thinking AI technology is all a bit too complicated for Warren Buffett, you're absolutely correct. Berkshire Hathaway's investments in AI stocks aren't found in the portfolio the Oracle of Omaha oversees. Rather, it's in what I like to refer to as ""Warren Buffett's secret portfolio.""

Back in 1998, Berkshire Hathaway acquired reinsurance company General Re for $22 billion. General Re also owned a specialty investment firm, known as New England Asset Management (NEAM). When Buffett's company bought General Re, it became the owner of NEAM as well. Today, NEAM has nearly $5.9 billion in assets under management. Even though Warren Buffett doesn't oversee NEAM's buying and selling activity, what NEAM owns is, ultimately, owned by Berkshire Hathaway.

Within this secret portfolio are three stocks where AI is very much part of the future.

The most prominent AI stock held by Warren Buffett's hidden portfolio is Microsoft (MSFT -2.18%). New England Asset Management was holding 55,743 shares of the company behind the most-popular operating system on the planet (Windows), as of Sept. 30, 2022.

Although a lot of focus has rightly been cast on Microsoft's rapidly growing cloud infrastructure service Azure, the buzz of late has to do with CEO Satya Nadella and his team introducing freshly updated versions of its Bing search engine and Edge web browser, now powered by AI.

Utilizing AI with Bing is a potential game-changer for Microsoft. Instead of users clicking on multiple pages to have their questions answered, AI can provide more thorough search queries without having to click on numerous links. AI-driven popups and sidebars can also provide answers to comprehensive questions, as well as allow for immediate actions taken by users. The latter is what could allow Bing to potentially chip away at Google's veritable monopoly in global internet search. Google is a subsidiary of Alphabet.

The AI software powering Bing comes from OpenAI, which is the company behind the popular AI-driven chatbot, ChatGPT. After investing $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019, Microsoft announced a multiyear, multibillion-dollar follow-up investment in OpenAI just last month.

While it's not uncommon for the buzz surrounding a next-big-thing investment to outpace tangible results, Microsoft has made it very clear AI is engrained in its future.

A second AI stock that's been a fixture in Warren Buffett's secret portfolio for the past eight years is tech stock IBM (IBM -0.17%). New England Asset Management closed out the third quarter with 36,805 shares of IBM in its investment portfolio.

"Got $1,000? 3 Simple Stocks to Buy Right Now
2023-02-10T10:40:00Z
News about the stock market and the global economy has many investors thinking the situation is pretty complicated right now. For many of those same investors, keeping their stock picks simple might just be the best strategy to address the complex financial world they operate in.

Here are three stocks that have straightforward investment narratives supporting long-term returns for different types of investors.

Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) has one of the best growth outlooks among semiconductor stocks. The company is known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) that support high-end visual outputs that are often required for gaming and viewing rich media content.

Nvidia remains a powerful brand in that industry, but its long-term prospects are actually more varied. Its chips have become best-in-class products that are used on a number of high-growth applications, including data centers, automobiles, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrencies. This gives the chipmaker some growth catalysts if customers across several growth industries ramp up demand.

Before buying Nvidia, investors should recognize that this is a growth stock in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry. That can result in volatility, which we saw inflict some damage on the stock price last year.

The stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is fairly high, having crept up to nearly 50 over recent months. That's not nearly as expensive as it's been in the past few years, but it's still expensive. This all comes with the territory for a stock like Nvidia, so investors should only get involved if they have a long-term view and can handle short-term volatility.

If you're wary of the risks associated with Nvidia, PepsiCo (PEP -0.20%) might suit you better, as an established leader in the global food and beverage industry.

The stock is not at all interesting from the perspective of growth, but it can be an absolute star for income investors and anyone trying to limit portfolio volatility. PepsiCo owns a massive portfolio of popular brands that include soft drinks, energy drinks, snacks, and a wide variety of food products. The company operates in just about any country that you can name.

It has successfully navigated deep recessions, economic booms, and rapidly evolving consumer tastes. PepsiCo just keeps on chugging along through all of it, slowly growing while producing more and more cash flow.

Shareholders have been a major beneficiary of this consistency. PepsiCo is a Dividend King, with 50 consecutive years of dividend growth. The stock has a 2.6% dividend yield, and the company's 64% payout ratio suggests that it isn't straining at all to maintain its shareholder distributions.

This is a straightforward business that warrants consideration from value investors, income investors, retirees, or anyone else who wants to balance out some growth stocks in their portfolio.

Costco Wholesale (COST -0.92%) straddles the line between growth and value. The discount-club chain is ultimately a low-margin retailer that's focused on consumer staples, so it's not a candidate to match the growth rates in the tech sector.

However, it has consistently delivered performance that outpaces expectations for most value stocks in the consumer staples sector. Costco's year-over-year revenue growth has remained above 6% over the past five years, approaching 20% in some quarters. That's quite uncommon among diversified retailers like this one.

The club membership model brings another key advantage. While retailing margins can be narrow, Costco generates a significant portion of operating profits from its annual membership fees. Member retention has been resilient across economic cycles, as consumers become focused on value during tough economic times. This brings stability to cash flows and creates some cushion for profits.

The stock's forward P/E is 35, which is a bit high for most growth investors, and its 0.7% dividend ratio is unlikely to excite anyone. That's why this is a hybrid sort of investment that might not be the first choice for either the growth or value crowd. Nonetheless, Costco is a remarkably stable business with above-average growth prospects that can be a straightforward addition to balance out any portfolio

"Warren Buffett's 5 Top AI Stocks -- Here's Why You Should Own Them, Too
2023-02-23T10:50:00Z
You might not think of Warren Buffett immediately when the topic of artificial intelligence comes up. The legendary investor has famously shied away from most tech stocks in the past, maintaining that those companies were outside of his circle of competence. Since AI represents one of the most advanced technologies around, it would be understandable if he avoided investing in AI-focused companies.

However, Buffett actually hasn't avoided AI stocks at all. Several of the technology's leaders can be found among Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.51%) (BRK.B 0.31%) holdings. Here are Buffett's top five AI stocks -- and why you should consider owning them, too.

If you looked at Berkshire Hathaway's latest 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), you'd probably identify only two stocks with obvious solid AI connections. Apple (AAPL -1.80%) ranks as the conglomerate's biggest stock holding by far. It also owns a relatively small stake in Amazon (AMZN -2.42%). Both of these companies are clearly heavily engaged in AI development. But where are the other AI stocks in Buffett's portfolio?

There are some companies in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio that are engaged in AI development. For example, Mastercard owns Brighterion, a company that develops AI applications for the financial, healthcare, and retail sectors. Nu Holdings owns Olivia AI, which develops AI solutions for financial companies. Several others in the portfolio -- among them American Express and Chevron -- are using AI in various ways.

However, I don't think any of these deserve spots among Buffett's top five AI stocks. Instead, we need to look at some other stocks that don't show up in Berkshire Hathaway's SEC filings. I'm referring to what could be called Buffett's ""secret portfolio"" -- stocks owned by Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary New England Asset Management (NEAM).

Like Berkshire Hathaway itself, NEAM owns a big stake in Apple. It also holds significant positions in Microsoft (MSFT -2.18%) and Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%). The investment firm initiated three new positions in the fourth quarter of 2022. AI pioneer Alphabet (GOOG -1.89%) (GOOGL -1.94%) arguably stood out as the best of the bunch.

There are other AI candidates in NEAM's portfolio, including such notable names as IBM and Intel. However, I think that Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet are the best AI stocks owned by Buffett.

Apple is the biggest technology company in the world by market cap. Unsurprisingly, it's also a leader in artificial intelligence. Millions of people use Apple's AI every day with Siri and facial recognition on iPhones. CEO Tim Cook stated in Apple's latest quarterly conference call that AI ""will affect every product and every service that we have.""

Amazon's AI efforts go beyond its Alexa virtual assistant. Amazon Web Services (AWS) incorporates AI extensively into its cloud-hosting services. The company's online product recommendations use advanced AI. Amazon uses AI throughout its internal operations as well.

Microsoft has been at the center of the conversation about AI in recent weeks because of its integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT with the Bing search engine. Its Azure cloud-hosting services, like AWS, feature lots of AI options for customers. Microsoft's Github Copilot uses AI to help programmers write code and is available as an extension for the company's Visual Studio platform.

Nvidia could be the preeminent pick-and-shovel AI play. The company's graphics process units (GPUs) are popular because of their ability to handle the intensive processing power requirements of AI apps. Nvidia has also developed platforms for speech AI and self-driving car technology.

Last but not least, Alphabet has long been a leader in AI development. Its Google and YouTube search engines use AI extensively. Google Cloud offers advanced AI capabilities to customers who use its cloud services. The company's Waymo unit is one of the top providers of AI-powered self-driving car technology. Google plans to soon launch Bard, its large language model that's expected to be a major rival to ChatGPT.

"3 AI Stocks to Buy Before the Coming Bull Market
2023-02-20T13:05:00Z
Artificial intelligence (AI) software has been around for many years, but big tech just unleashed a new kind called generative AI -- services that can use massive amounts of data to aid in the creation of new content. Microsoft invested in ChatGPT parent OpenAI, which has prompted a response from Alphabet with its Google Bard system. Other companies are following suit and figuring out ways to put AI to work in their own opertions.

A new round of software investment is thus heating up and laying the groundwork for the next bull market. Businesses that are ready for the coming boom could be in store for big gains. Three Fool.com contributors think Micron Technology (MU -0.97%), Lemonade (LMND -5.85%), and Palo Alto Networks (PANW -1.12%) are a great buy right now. Here's why.

Billy Duberstein (Micron Technology): The memory and storage industry is in its worst downturn since 2008, but as bad as the current downturn is, could the memory stocks bounce back just as hard next year, in a ""V-shaped"" recovery?

While that scenario may not necessarily pan out, the possibility is certainly there. And if that's the case, Micron Technology stock would look very, very cheap today.

What could make that scenario come about? Well, demand evaporated last year just as the memory producers increased production from the strong demand in 2021, leading to oversupply. Therefore, if demand comes back with a vengeance while memory producers scale back production, that could have the opposite effect, increasing prices.

On that note, on its earnings call back in December, Micron announced a dramatic 40% decrease in 2023 capital expenditures, with a more than 50% reduction in capital equipment spend, along with a 10% cut to its headcount and a 20% near-term decrease in its current wafer starts.

Meanwhile, large rival SK Hynix, which also makes DRAM and NAND and reported results on Feb. 7, also announced a large 50%-plus cut to its own capital spending cut for 2023. While the third and largest DRAM manufacturer, Samsung, announced capital expenditures would remain flat, management also indicated most would go toward building new clean rooms and node technology transitions, not capacity expansions, and that certain upgrades would actually take some wafer production offline this year.

With at least two of the large players meaningfully scaling back production, limiting supply, there is the chance that demand could rebound. Memory price declines have led to an increase in density per device in phones and servers, due to the demand elasticity from lower prices. Furthermore, China's reopening could unexpectedly increase demand this year for smartphones and PCs. Meanwhile, last Wednesday's retail sales strength also pointed to perhaps a stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer as well.

But what could really spark demand to the upside are the AI wars that have kicked off with large language models such as ChatGPT. AI applications require huge amounts of fast processing and data storage. Meanwhile, the major processor chipmakers, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, have each recently released new high-performance processors that will likely be deployed into these AI applications this year. As those are adopted, they will require new, higher-density and more expensive memory technologies such as DDR5 and high-bandwidth memory (HBM).

A recent Feb. 14 article in Business Korea noted SK Hynix and Samsung have seen a ""surge"" in new orders for HBM chips since the beginning of the year. And although that was in a Korean publication, leaving Micron out, Micron also makes HBM. While HBM is a relatively small part of the overall DRAM market today, the note is still a promising indicator that the AI wars could help spark a rebound in memory demand.

With suppliers pulling back on production and the potential for demand to surprise to the upside, investors shouldn't rule out a strong rebound for memory prices. In fact, SK Hynix's management said on their Feb. 7 conference call, ""we expect that not only will inventory levels normalize this year, but also a better than expected upturn may come next year.""

"3 Top Stocks to Profit From the Coming AI Explosion
2023-02-10T11:17:00Z
AI is taking the investing world by storm at an interesting time. Tech giants have been announcing tens of thousands of layoffs in recent months as the economy begins to slow. Meanwhile, new AI services like ChatGPT (Microsoft's new toy) and Alphabet's Bard and investment in AI start-up Anthropic are receiving billions of dollars' worth of attention. Perhaps Meta Platforms (CEO Mark Zuckerberg summed it up best, stating 2023 would be the ""year of efficiency."" Human workers are out, and big-tech, super-efficient AI systems are in.

But we humans can strike back by investing in the companies that are enabling this AI in the first place. Here's how.

The data center infrastructure spending spree is still in effect

A data center build-out arms race has been in effect for years now. Big tech, in particular, has been spending heavily to support cloud computing and AI workloads. Meta specifically reported a massive surge in capital expenditures (or capex, spending on property and equipment) in support of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, as well as its Reality Labs VR segment in 2022.

It's not just Meta in heavy-spend mode, though. All the cloud software giants are gearing up for another decade of cloud growth. Microsoft may have just fired the starting gun on the next race with its $10 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, spending which is not yet included in the 2022 CapEx table below.

But what of 2023 being the year of efficiency? Much of big tech's spending cutbacks will be on employees, office space, and other variable operating expenses. Meta is a perfect example of how this will play out. At the end of 2022, the social media giant reported total employees of 86,482, which doesn't include most of the 11,000 job cuts it has announced. However, 2023 capex (mostly on data centers and related technology) is expected to be $30 billion to $33 billion. That's lower than the previous forecast for $34 billion to $37 billion, but the upper end of that guidance would still exceed the more than $31 billion in capex in 2022.

Indeed, the ""year of efficiency"" is good news for the machines.

How to profit from the rise of AI

For every AI system put into operation (be it ChatGPT, Alphabet's counterattack Bard, or a user recommendation via Facebook or Instagram), there's a semiconductor behind the scenes working away.

In fact, with the commercialization of AI, a lot more chips will need to be employed. Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) CEO Jensen Huang has been discussing this for years, indicating that the market for inference (when AI is asked to complete a task) will be much larger than that for AI software training. Back in the autumn of 2020, Huang had said that the vast majority of inference work was done by CPUs (like those made by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)). But with AI complexity only increasing, the tech world has been shifting toward the GPU, Nvidia's specialty.

Nvidia is a pricey stock at this juncture (90 times trailing 12-month earnings, or 44 times one-year forward expected earnings) after nearly doubling in price from October 2022 until this writing. But if you believe the battle for AI supremacy is only heating up, Nvidia could still be a top way to profit over the next decade. Meta recently said it is pausing some data center build-outs as it finalizes a new architecture built for AI. Details are scant at this point, but this new construction almost certainly favors heavier use of GPUs.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.08%) should be another top beneficiary. The company has been gobbling up market share of the data center CPU space from Intel for years, and the trend will likely continue. AMD recently announced new versions of its fast-growing Epyc CPUs, named Genoa. A new CPU-GPU combo unit called the MI300 -- an APU (accelerated processing unit) -- will also come out in the second half of 2023.

Paired with its early 2022 acquisition of enterprise chip designer Xilinx, AMD has made a hard pivot away from consumer electronics to address the fast-moving data center industry. At just 19 times one-year forward expected earnings, AMD looks like a top semiconductor stock buy right now.

"Watch: John Deere's High-Tech Tractor Will Amaze You
2023-02-07T11:52:00Z
CES in Las Vegas is the world's largest tech show, with awesome displays of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles. This year, my favorite example of all these futuristic technologies comes from a company many associate more with Green Acres than Silicon Valley.

John Deere (DE -1.80%) may be 186 years old, but it wowed CES visitors with its massive combine tractor that saves 60% in chemical costs by using AI, NVIDIA processors, and sensors to spray chemicals with pinpoint control. The company also showed off other futuristic technology, including its self-driving tractor and an app that allows farmers to monitor all aspects of their tractors in the fields.

Watch the video below for a guided technological tour from Julian Sanchez, director of emerging technologies in John Deere's Intelligent Solutions Group (ISG).

Find out why Nvidia is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now Our award-winning analyst team has spent more than a decade beating the market. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* They just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now. Nvidia is on the list -- but there are nine others you may be overlooking. Click here to get access to the full list!

Julian Sanchez:

[00:00:00] We're going to get real close and personal to the technology that we call See & Spray. See & Spray is a technology that gets mounted to a sprayer, sprayers used to drive through a field and apply herbicides or nutrients to plants. What we've done is we've added 36 cameras to this 120 foot carbon fiber boom, and we've added 10 NVIDIA GPUs that are housed in a special case and they keeps them passively cooled so that they can withstand very harsh conditions. As this machine is moving through the field at 12 miles an hour, those cameras are looking ahead, and they're looking to detect weeds on the ground. If you look over there, those x's represent weeds. The machine detects those weeds and applies herbicides only to the weeds. The herbicides [00:01:00] come out from underneath here in these nozzles. Every time the camera sees a weed, it sends a message, and within a millisecond it activates these nozzles and then sprays only the weeds.

This system has the ability and potential to save farmers 2/3 of the herbicides their use. Huge economic impact, but even more of an environmental impact. The magic in developing the system is we had to spend several years capturing images of what different weeds look like all over the world, and training a deep neural network in this is what weeds look like, this is what a plant looks like. Again, here you see a visual representation. Let's assume this machine was moving at 12 miles an hour. That's the speed at which we could operate using the system. The rows, those represent crops, those are plants, could be corn, could be soybeans. Every once in the middle there you see weeds.

[00:02:00] Again, that's what those cameras are looking for and they're only spraying those weeds. Again, deep neural network, one of the most sophisticated artificial intelligence system that is real is being used by farmers already today. It works extremely well in the harshest of conditions. Again, we're talking about dusty fields, crosswinds, different lighting conditions.

The ruggedization of this advanced AI system on the edge is tremendous. One last important point is all of the vehicles that we make come with connectivity. All of this data does get transmitted to the Cloud so the farmer can review it later. However, because we're in rural environments, we can't rely on connectivity all the time. All the compute is done at the edge.

This system is also intended to save on chemicals. What happens when this is a planter and [00:03:00] as this moves through the field, it's dropping seeds, it drops 30 seeds per second. Traditionally, what happens is, something that called starter fertilizer gets applied. Can we move around you real quick here just to see? Can you run it? The seeds are going to be coming out at 30 per second. Traditionally, what happen is you run that. Is there a thing? [inaudible 00:03:30] second. Got you. Yeah, perfect. Right now, the technology, as of today, we just continuously apply starter fertilizer. You'll see it in the second, it'll start to pulse. Now we time each seed with a pulse. Again, this also has the opportunity to save 60 percent and starter fertilizer.

"Is Texas Instruments Stock a Better Buy Than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing?
2023-02-07T11:11:00Z
Texas Instruments (TXN -1.56%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -2.19%) are two of the most important companies in the world, and their importance is only rising. They are also incredibly important stocks to countless investors. Chips are proliferating throughout the economy and receiving massive amounts of capital investment -- everything from automotive and industrial automation (Texas Instruments' specialty) to data centers and artificial intelligence, or AI (a top end-market for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing).

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is by far the larger of the two businesses and is an inseparable partner for all of the top fabless chip designers (those that don't manufacture themselves, like Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Apple, to name just a few). But could a case be made that Texas Instruments (TI), a company that focuses on ""old and boring"" chip technology, is actually the better investment? Below, two Fool.com contributors take opposing sides on this debate.

Texas Instruments has spent decades building a moat around its business

Jason Hall: In general, the analog semiconductor industry (a chip that can interact with a real-world signal, like sound waves, light, radio waves, etc.) is misunderstood. Much of TI's spending is on strengthening its moats (a defensive advantage it has over competitors), including manufacturing cost efficiency. In contrast, TSMC is largely spending because it has to stay at the leading edge of the technology curve. It's maintaining an edge while TI is sharpening its edge. And that's the secret to continued superior economic returns for investors.

For example, since the beginning of 2018, both companies have greatly expanded their capital spending (on equipment and property) to expand manufacturing capacity. But TI has doubled its dividend payment over that span of time, while TSMC slashed its dividend to help fund those capital expenditures.

TI probably has some of the strongest economic moats in the semiconductor industry, ironically because it's focused on ""boring"" industrial and automotive markets. Those industries prioritize durability and replaceability.

Think about auto parts stores: They sell thousands of different low-cost parts for vehicles that have been on the road for decades. It's the same thing in industrial equipment and manufacturing. You can't replace a million-dollar machine because a $100 chip is no longer available.

Companies keep going back to TI because it's a reliable partner that helps them keep their industrial operations running smoothly. None of this mentions the e-commerce business TI has created, which makes it easy for its customers to order the parts it needs from an expansive catalog with the rare need to ask for a custom design to be made. This is a massive advantage that's not going away, and a difficult (and expensive) model to try to imitate.

Taiwan Semiconductor has some incredible competitive advantages, too

Nicholas Rossolillo: Let's not take too much away from what TSMC is doing, because the world would suffer unimaginable disruption if this company were to suddenly be taken out of commission. TSMC has deep pockets, and as long as it keeps using those deep pockets to maintain its incredible lead in the most advanced chipmaking capabilities around, numerous fabless chip designers will keep going back to TSMC as their preferred manufacturing partner.

Of course, companies like Samsung have been investing heavily to catch up to TSMC. And though the company's in pitiful condition right now, a lot of the world's need to diversify global supply chains hinge on Intel turning things around and creating a TSMC-like business model that caters to other chip designers.

But this is the secret ingredient that makes TSMC special. Samsung has a foundry business for other chip designers, and Intel wants a bigger foundry business to cater to its peers, too, but both Samsung and Intel also compete with their foundry customers. They make chips for themselves and market them to consumers. For example, Samsung might offer to manufacture smartphone chips for another company, but it sells its own smartphones, too. Intel might offer to manufacture chips for, say, Nvidia, but it has competing silicon designs of its own.

"Bill Gates Buys Stake in Heineken Parent Company
2023-02-23T01:00:29Z
For more crisp and insightful business and economic news, subscribe to The Daily Upside newsletter. It's completely free and we guarantee you'll learn something new every day.

Don't be surprised if your Windows laptop starts suggesting you crack open an ice-cold beer while it does yet another update.

Former Microsoft CEO/World's Richest Man Bill Gates has bought a 3.76% stake in the company that owns Heineken beer, according to Dutch outlet RTL Nieuws.

The $936 million investment is slightly out of character with the rest of Gates' portfolio, which tends to be more in line with his philanthropic save-the-planet persona. His investment in vaccines both personally and via his charitable foundation is long-standing. At the end of last year, he invested in brain-computer interface start-up Synchron along with fellow gazillionaire Jeff Bezos.

Gates is also heavily invested in agriculture; he's the largest private farmland owner in the US and in January he backed a climate start-up that hopes to reduce the amount of methane produced by livestock.

So why beer, and why now?
• The beer market isn't looking quite as hale and hearty as it once did, but Heineken announced plans last week for a big marketing push to give its premium products some buzz.
• This isn't the first time Gates has bet on cerveza -- in 2007 he bought up 3% of a Mexican brewery called Femsa. The stake was worth $392 million.

Brad in Brussels: While Gates hoovers up stock in a Dutch brewer, current Microsoft president Brad Smith is next door in Belgium lobbying EU regulators to let the company buy Activision Blizzard, an acquisition that has already raised antitrust eyebrows in the UK. He managed to win over gaming giants Nintendo and Nvidia to his cause, but that's mostly window dressing as the real competitor most likely to be hard-hit is PlayStation. Time for some tech giant Smash Bros."
"Want to Invest in the Semiconductor Industry but Don't Know How? Try This ETF.
2023-02-16T13:43:00Z
Semiconductors are those little chips or circuits that are essential to drive computers, appliances, electronics, and all other manner of technology.

They have also driven the stock market in recent years, with many of the companies in this industry posting huge gains over the past decade. In fact, only three other industries have outperformed semiconductors over the past 10 years.

It can be a little confusing for investors, because often, semiconductor stocks are lumped in with other types of technology stocks in technology-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A good broad-based technology ETF should be a pillar of a diversified portfolio, but investors might want to add a little more alpha with an ETF that includes only stocks from the booming chipmaking industry.

There are quite a few ETFs that focus just on semiconductors, but the best, and broadest, is the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD -1.09%). This ETF tracks the S&P Semiconductor Select Index, which includes semiconductor companies within the S&P Total Market Index. So, as it draws from that broad market index, it includes semiconductor stocks of all sizes -- large, mid, and small caps.

Overall, it holds about 39 stocks and is equally weighted, which means the big companies, like Intel, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices, have roughly the same weight in the portfolio as smaller companies like Cirrus Logic and Allegro MicroSystems. The equal weighting gives the fund a little more diversification than a market-cap weighting ETF would, which helps it outperform in down markets.

If you look at this ETF's performance last year, it was down about 30.8% in 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite, a barometer for technology stocks, was down about 33%. More specifically, the Invesco QQQ, an ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100, was down about 32.6% last year.

But if you look at the longer-term numbers, the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF outperforms the Nasdaq and the QQQ. It was juiced over the course of the bull market by a more-concentrated portfolio focused on a high-performing industry.

Over the past three-, five-, and 10-year periods through Jan. 31, the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF has had average annual returns of 24.7%, 22.4%, and 24.1%, respectively. As the chart shows, over the last 10 years through Jan. 31, the Nasdaq Composite has an annualized return of 15.1% while the Invesco QQQ has posted a 17.1% annual return.

It also performed better over the past one-, three- and five-year periods than many other semiconductor-focused ETFs.

While the names of companies prospering in the industry might change, semiconductors aren't going anywhere. In fact, in this digital age, they are just going to become increasingly essential. A recent report from Fortune Business Insights projected that the global semiconductor industry will more than double in size by 2029, from roughly $528 billion in 2021 to $1.4 trillion by 2029.

You could try to pick the best semiconductor stock, and there are a lot of good ones. But a better strategy to tap into the growth of semiconductors is an ETF like the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF.

As a concentrated sector ETF, it should only represent a small portion of your portfolio and be balanced out with a diversified mix of stocks and ETFs. But it would certainly be an excellent choice to fill any aggressive growth void you may have."
"Better Buy: AMD vs. Intel
2023-02-23T14:05:42Z
The stock market's strong start to 2023 has rubbed off positively on shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.08%), but rival Intel (INTC -1.83%) hasn't been able to take advantage of the rally.

While AMD stock is up over 18% so far in 2023, outpacing the Nasdaq Composite index's 10% jump, Intel is down about 3.6%. Let's see why that's the case and see if AMD will continue to remain the better semiconductor stock of the two from an investor's standpoint.

AMD's rally this year has been helped by its better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results, which were released on Jan. 31. Of course, the chipmaker's near-term prospects aren't all that bright thanks to the weakness in the personal computer (PC) market, but CEO Lisa Su's confidence in AMD's data center growth and its ability to take market share away from Intel are probably the reasons why investors gave its latest earnings report a thumbs-up.

Additionally, a report from Mercury Research points out that AMD ended 2022 with 31.3% of the x86 central processing unit (CPU) market under its control, an impressive jump of 5.7 percentage points over the prior-year period. The server market played a key role in AMD's market share jump. Mercury Research estimates that AMD gained an impressive 6.9 percentage points of market share year over year in server CPUs in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 17.6%.

This explains why AMD's data center revenue increased an impressive 63% last year to $6 billion, helping offset the weakness in the PC market to a large extent. A similar story may unfold in 2023 as Su expects the data center business to pick up in the second half of the year, and the CEO feels ""very good about our market share position and opportunity to grow with the data center.""

Wall Street analysts also expect AMD to gain more share in 2023 thanks to its recently launched fourth-generation server processors that are reportedly better than Intel's Ice Lake processors, especially considering that the former has already built a solid customer base for its latest offerings. According to one estimate from KeyBanc Capital Markets, AMD could exit 2023 with 30% of the server CPU market under its control.

IDC estimates that the x86 server processor market could generate $112.5 billion in revenue in 2023, up from $110.3 billion last year. So, a stronger share of this market could significantly boost AMD's data center revenue and give the company's overall growth a nice shot in the arm as it gets 30% of its revenue from selling data center processors.

Intel released its fourth-quarter 2022 results at the end of January 2023, and the numbers were terrible. Its adjusted revenue fell 28% year over year to $14 billion in the fourth quarter. Chipzilla also turned in a loss of $0.10 per share for the quarter as compared to a profit of $1.15 per share in 2021. For the full year, Intel's top line fell 16% to $63 billion, while adjusted earnings per share dropped 65% to $1.84 for the full year.

Analysts aren't expecting any better from Intel in 2023. Its revenue is expected to fall nearly 20% to $50.8 billion, while adjusted earnings are expected to shrink to $0.55 per share. However, the semiconductor giant may be able to turn in a better-than-expected performance this year itself for a few reasons.

First, the decline in the PC market in 2023 isn't expected to be as severe as last year. Gartner estimates that PC shipments could drop 6.8% this year following 2022's drop of 16%. The research firm also adds that PC inventories could start returning to normal levels in the second half, which should pave the way for an improvement in processor sales.

A turnaround in PC sales later this year could be a tailwind for Intel, given its dominance in this space. The company exited 2022 with 81% of the desktop CPU market under its control, while its share of mobile CPUs stood at 83.6%. It is worth noting that Intel gained a healthy 5.1 percentage points of market share in mobile CPUs in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the prior-year period.

"2 No-Brainer Growth Stocks to Buy in 2023
2023-01-24T18:44:41Z
After a year when countless tech companies suffered significant declines in their stocks and earnings because of macroeconomic headwinds, 2023 has shown signs that the market is recovering. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has risen almost 8% since the start of the year, as many stocks have gradually trended upward. As a result, now is an excellent time to invest in growth stocks while they're still down year over year.

Because technology is constantly developing, the industry is a great place to hold an investment over the long term because it is likely to provide consistent gains.

Here are two no-brainer growth stocks to buy in 2023.

Along with numerous other growth stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.08%) was hit hard in 2022 by reduced spending on tech and rises in inflation. However, the dismal year hasn't hampered its stellar long-term prospects. Even with last year's sell-off, AMD's shares have increased 493% over the previous five years and almost 3,000% in the last decade.

Meanwhile, the semiconductor company's revenue has increased 153% since 2018 to $16.4 billion in 2022, with operating income rising 1,000% to $2.6 billion. As a result, now is an excellent time to invest in this undervalued growth stock, with its price still down 36% year over year.

Despite declines in its PC-focused client segment in the third quarter of 2022, AMD's biggest earning segment, data centers, did not disappoint. The company's data center business saw revenue increase 45% year over year to $1.6 billion, with operating income rising 64% to $505 million. And the company has plans to expand further in this booming market.

In November, AMD launched a new generation of data center chips named Genoa, and plans to release a more powerful version called Genoa-X later this year. With companies such as Alphabet's Google, Microsoft's Azure, and Oracle already signed on as clients, AMD is well-positioned to continue profiting from the market's expansion.

The company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.7 is especially attractive considering its prospects. The same metric for its biggest competitor, Nvidia, is 57.6.

Advanced Micro Devices' stock was battered in 2022, but it is unlikely to be down forever, considering its consistent long-term performance. The company's shares have risen 16% since Jan. 1 as investors reevaluate AMD's potential. As a result, now could be the perfect time to invest in this exceptional growth stock.

Apple (AAPL -1.80%) is a solid growth stock in all aspects. Over the last five years, the company's shares have soared 211%, and 664% in the last decade.

Revenue has risen 48% since 2018 to $394.3 billion in 2022, and operating income has increased by over 80% to $119.4 billion in the same period. That is primarily thanks to strong, consistent demand for its products and a talent for successfully entering new markets.

In 2022, Apple's iPhone officially surpassed Alphabet's Android for smartphone market share by hitting 50%, according to Counterpoint Research. This is particularly encouraging thanks to its walled garden of products, where one purchase can encourage consumers to dive deeper into the company's varied lineup of other devices and services.

And 2023 holds a lot of promise for the tech giant. In the first 20 days of the year, Apple announced MacBook Pros featuring more powerful chips, a beefier Mac Mini, and a second-generation HomePod.

Reports say the company will soon enter the augmented/virtual reality markets with a new headset and is working toward reducing its dependency on other companies by using more in-house components in its iPhones. Each of these developments has the potential to significantly increase revenue over the long term, making Apple's stock a screaming buy in 2023."
"3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy During a Recession
2023-02-06T14:07:36Z
Fears of a recession and other macro headwinds often drive investors to dump their tech stocks and invest in more defensive sectors. However, many tech companies are actually well-equipped to handle deep economic downturns.

Today I'll take a closer look at three tech companies that should remain promising investments during a recession: the cloud-based services provider ServiceNow (NOW -3.65%), the diversified chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO -1.04%), and the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML -3.09%).

ServiceNow's cloud-based tools help companies streamline their work patterns into digital workflows. That digitization process makes it easier for companies to expand, reduce their costs, and support remote workers. It's naturally insulated from recessions since economic downturns usually highlight the growing need for its digital transformation services.

ServiceNow's annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30% between 2017 and 2022, and it expects that momentum to continue with a CAGR of at least 21% from 2022 to 2026. Unlike many other high-growth cloud software companies, ServiceNow is firmly profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis.

ServiceNow's stock isn't cheap at 53 times forward earnings, and its near-term growth might be crimped by macro and currency challenges. But its early-mover's advantage in digital workflow tools, the stickiness of its subscriptions, and its stable gross margins all suggest it deserves to trade at a premium to slower-growth cloud plays like Salesforce.

Broadcom develops a wide range of chips for the data center, networking, broadband, wireless, storage, and industrial markets. It also operates a smaller infrastructure software business, which could grow a lot larger if its proposed takeover of the cloud giant VMware is finally approved.

Broadcom's top client is Apple, which accounted for a fifth of its revenue last year. But it also has limited exposure to the post-pandemic slowdown of the PC market, and it's benefited from the accelerating pace of infrastructure upgrades over the past year.

That diversification makes Broadcom a more balanced semiconductor play than many of its chipmaking peers. Its annual revenue rose at a CAGR of 13% from 2017 to 2022, and analysts expect a stable CAGR of 5% from 2022 to 2025, even as the broader chip market experiences a cyclical slowdown. That outlook doesn't account for its takeover of VMware, which would significantly boost its revenue and reduce its dependence on Apple.

Broadcom is firmly profitable, its stock trades at just 14 times forward earnings, and it pays a hefty forward yield of 3.1%. Those fundamental strengths should make it a sound stock to hold during a recession.

Fabless chipmakers like Broadcom, Qualcomm, Nvidia, and AMD all outsource the production of their chips to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung. However, TSMC and Samsung can't actually manufacture their most advanced chips without ASML's lithography systems, which are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers.

ASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems, and it's the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems, which are used to manufacture the world's smallest and densest chips. ASML's monopolization of these systems, which cost $200 million each and require multiple planes to ship, makes it a linchpin of the semiconductor market.

Between 2017 and 2022 ASML's annual revenue grew at a CAGR of 19% as its gross margin expanded from 45% to 50.5%. It expects its top line to continue growing at a CAGR of about 12% from 2022 to 2030 (at the midpoint of its long-term estimates) as its gross margin expands to 56%-60% by the final year.

ASML's stock might seem a bit pricey at 32 times forward earnings, but it will likely remain one of the most important -- and recession-resistant -- technology companies for the foreseeable future."
"Thinking of Buying Chip Stocks? Avoid This One at All Costs
2023-02-01T15:10:00Z
Heading into Intel's (INTC -1.83%) fourth-quarter earnings report, investors knew the semiconductor industry was struggling, but Intel's results were still astonishingly bad. The chipmaker posted a dismal report across the board, missing analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, and its guidance even called for a loss in the first quarter of 2023.

Intel's fourth-quarter revenue plunged 32% year over year, or 28% on an adjusted basis, to $14 billion, below the analyst consensus estimate of $14.5 billion. The company cited economic and market headwinds, which include falling prices in the chip market and declining demand for PCs. Sales plunged in its two core business segments: The client computing group, which is primarily PCs, was down 36% year over year, and the data center and artificial intelligence segment was off 33%.

Its performance further down the income statement was even worse. Gross margin collapsed by 14.5 percentage points to 39.2%, and adjusted operating margin plunged from 28.2% to 4.3%. On the bottom line, Intel's adjusted earnings per share fell from $1.15 in the quarter a year ago to just $0.10, missing the analyst consensus estimate of $0.20.

Lastly, management's first-quarter guidance called for Intel's performance to further deteriorate with a forecast for revenue of just $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, which represents a 40% year-over-year decline at the midpoint and was much worse than the average estimate at $13.9 billion. On the bottom line, management expects an adjusted loss of $0.15 per share, compared to the consensus of a $0.24-per-share profit.

Intel's results might mostly reflect the difficult environment for chipmakers, especially those in the PC and data center industries. But they also highlight the company's own execution problems as well as its failure to adapt to market demand.

Intel has a long history of value destruction

Intel was one of the darlings of the dot-com era, but since then, the stock has gone almost nowhere. It's still down from its peak in 2000, and you could have bought shares at any point since then and still underperformed the market.

Intel's business has steadily grown over the last 20 years, but a combination of multiple compression (when a company's earnings increase, but its stock price does not move in response), market share losses, and falling profit margins have weighed on it and even erased most of the gains over the last decade.

A series of poor management decisions, execution problems, and misguided acquisitions have cost investors over the years, and the company fell behind rivals as the semiconductor industry boomed. Advanced Micro Devices has consistently grabbed market share from it in the PC market, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has left it behind in manufacturing advanced chips, and it's missed out on newer markets that peers like Nvidia and Broadcom have captured.

As the chart below shows, all four of those stocks have trounced Intel over the last decade, a sign that its errors are primarily self-inflicted.

Intel's dependence on the PC market means it's exposed to one of the slower-growing areas of the chip industry, and it's struggled with manufacturing, making AMD look smart for outsourcing fabrication to foundries like TSMC.

The company has also made a number of questionable acquisitions over the years, including Altera, a maker of programmable logic chips, which has fallen behind rival Xilinx.

After acquiring Barefoot Networks in 2019, it just announced it would no longer produce the network-switching chips Barefoot makes. Intel is in the black on its Mobileye acquisition, but its current valuation is well below the company's $50 billion target at the time it announced the initial public offering, and at least part of the reason for the spinoff seems to be that Mobileye's founders were chafing under Intel's management.

While Intel's returns have underwhelmed, there was a silver lining for investors: The chip stock has long been a reliable dividend payer. But even that could be at risk now. In 2022, the company lost $9.4 billion in free cash flow, and the first-quarter guidance indicates that the company is likely to burn cash at least through the first half of the year. It also has more than $40 billion in debt on its balance sheet.

"1 ETF to Make Investing Easy for You in 2023
2023-01-25T11:47:00Z
No one knows for sure what the market will do in 2023, but long-term investors do know one thing: The bear market will eventually end, and a new bull market will begin.

That's been the case with every bear market in U.S. history and includes calamities like the Great Depression and both World Wars, as well as more recent market crashes like the great financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.

If you're nervous about buying stocks, that's understandable after last year's rout. Picking stocks is risky by nature, and even long-term winners can have off years. If you want a lower-risk way to enjoy the benefits of the stock market, there's an easier way to do it. You can invest in ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. These are funds that trade just like a stock, but hold dozens of individual stocks, allowing you as an investor to get exposure to a broad array of companies with just one investment. The only cost to you is a small annual commission, known as an expense ratio, to run the fund. Often the expense ratio is 0.1% or less of your investment, making it worth the convenience.

One of the most popular ways to invest in ETFs is through index funds, which track an index like the S&P 500, but there's one index fund that looks particularly ripe for the picking right now. That's the Invesco Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (QQQM -1.66%)

All about the Nasdaq-100

The Nasdaq-100 holds the 100 largest Nasdaq-listed nonfinancial companies, or the top stocks in the Nasdaq Composite.

Historically, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has been more volatile than the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average as tech stocks tend to trade at higher valuations, making them more vulnerable to market cycles and crashes.

Last year, the Nasdaq Composite significantly underperformed the two major indexes, and the Nasdaq-100 essentially matched the Nasdaq Composite index for the year.

Last year's sell-off in tech stocks came after huge gains in 2020 and 2021, and despite its steep losses last year, the Nasdaq Composite has outperformed the Dow and S&P 500 over a longer time horizon, and the Nasdaq-100 has done even better. Here's a chart for the last 10 years, and one that dates back to the 1990s.

As you can see, the Nasdaq-100 has beaten the Nasdaq Composite by a significant margin. That makes sense since the Nasdaq-100 is essentially a self-selecting group of the best Nasdaq stocks. Only top performers get into the club.

Even better, the Nasdaq-100 has utterly crushed the S&P 500, essentially doubling its growth over a decade, and nearly beating it by a factor of 4 going back to the 1990s. Even with dividends factored in, the Nasdaq-100 is the clear winner.

Why it's time to buy the Nasdaq-100

Now looks like an especially opportune moment to buy the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF. Its biggest holdings like Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon all fell sharply last year, and these stocks have a long history of outperformance. Together, they make up roughly 40% of the value of the Nasdaq-100.

They're also likely to rebound when the economy starts to recover as the tech industry tends to be cyclical, and they're all trading at cheap valuations compared to recent years. Three of them -- Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon -- have announced major layoffs in the last few weeks, making it more likely that they'll emerge from the current downturn even more profitable.

Additionally, the dollar has weakened significantly over the last three months, which means that the headwinds from a stronger dollar over the past year could soon dissipate and turn into tailwinds by the end of the year.

The volatility of the Nasdaq swings both ways. The index is likely to benefit from a recovery in the economy, and these stocks should beat the broad market when the next bull market begins.

Buying the Invesco ETF is the easiest way to get exposure to these stocks and other proven winners like Nvidia and Tesla, and it charges an expense ratio of just 0.15%.

If you want an easy, low-risk way to beat the market in the recovery, skip the stock-picking and consider buying shares of the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF

"AMD Stock: Bear vs. Bull
2023-02-23T10:40:00Z
Like many tech stocks in 2023, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -2.08%) shares have been rising since Jan. 1. The semiconductor company's stock was up about 21% since the start of the year after better-than-expected quarterly results and AMD's potential in the future of artificial intelligence.

The last 12 months have been a roller-coaster ride for AMD investors as market declines led tech stocks to fall out of favor in 2022, dragging the company's shares down 55% throughout the year. However, AMD proved its resilience by pivoting to more lucrative parts of its business.

As a result, there are bears and bulls when it comes to investing in AMD's stock. So, let's examine both arguments and decide whether the company is worth an investment this year.

In 2022, macroeconomic headwinds led to steep declines in the personal computer market, with the industry's biggest players, such as AMD, Nvidia, and Intel, suffering stock declines between 48% to 55% over the year. In fact, according to Gartner, worldwide PC shipments tumbled 28.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 16.2% for the year. Meanwhile, consumer spending on PC components fell harder, with worldwide shipments for graphics processing units (GPUs) falling 42% throughout 2022.

AMD felt the market declines hardest in its client segment, primarily made up of consumer processors and GPUs. Revenue in the segment fell 50% in 2022, with operating losses totaling $152 million. AMD's gaming segment also suffered as revenue slipped 6% year over year to $1.6 billion, and operating income fell 34% to $266 million. The segment was burdened by reduced sales from PC gamers who scaled back on GPU and processor (CPU) upgrades.

With PC components still a massive part of AMD's business and the market not yet showing signs of improving, bears are concerned additional economic declines will only lengthen the time it takes for the company's stock to recover fully. However, its 8% market share in consumer GPUs compared to Nvidia's 88% means AMD has less to lose in the space than its biggest competitor.

Despite the PC market slump, AMD proved its resiliency over the last year by pivoting to parts of its business less affected by the economic downturn. While its client and gaming segments took hits, its data center and embedded businesses flourished, proving the strength of diversification.

In 2022, AMD's data center segment brought in the most revenue, hitting $1.65 billion and rising 42% year over year. The growth is primarily owed to the booming cloud market, worth $368.97 billion in 2021 and projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 14.1% through 2030, according to Grand View Research.

Additionally, AMD recently made promising strides in data centers with the launch of its Genoa series server chips in November 2022. The new chips were released ahead of competing hardware from Intel, which launched its Sapphire Rapids data center chips in January 2023 after two years of delays. Meanwhile, benchmarks have proved AMD's chips are outperforming Intel's, creating more anticipation for its more powerful Genoa-X server chips launching later this year.

Moreover, AMD's embedded segment has skyrocketed over the last year thanks to its acquisition of Xilinx in 2022, a company specializing in developing programmable CPUs used in products for artificial intelligence, aerospace and defense, industrial, and space. AMD's embedded segment saw revenue soar more than 1,800% in 2022 to $1.39 billion, boosting the company's long-term outlook.

AMD's gaming business also benefited from the company's priority of diversification, as its position in game consoles was able to offset reduced sales from PC gamers. AMD exclusively supplies the graphics and processing power through its system on a chip to Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S, with the success of these consoles retaining profitability in the segment.

AMD suffered a challenging year in 2022 amid substantial declines in the PC market. However, economic declines won't last forever, and the company's success in other markets has proved it can pivot when necessary. As a result, the bulls win this one, making AMD's stock a screaming buy this year

"Beth Kindig on AI, Semiconductors, and Tech Cycles
2023-02-18T15:09:00Z
Beth Kindig is the lead technology analyst for the I/O Fund. Motley Fool analyst Deidre Woollard caught up with Kindig to discuss:
• Where we are in the cloud adoption cycle.
• What to learn from companies that went public too quickly.

To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our podcast center. To get started investing, check out our quick-start guide to investing in stocks. A full transcript follows the video.

This video was recorded on February 12, 2023.

Beth Kindig: Money could potentially dry up. I am very firm on the fact that the dot-com bust is not what we're looking at because technology today plays a much greater role and a very important role, but I will say that some of the parallels around the private markets are there.

Chris Hill: I'm Chris Hill and that's Beth Kindig, the lead technology analyst at the I/O Fund. Deidre Woollard caught up with her to talk about how the big macro has changed everything about tech investing, what to watch as semiconductor companies report earnings, and the uses for artificial intelligence that don't get as much attention as they probably should.

Deidre Woollard: You focus mostly on individual companies, but we've got to talk a little bit macro here. How has the macro-environment changed or has it changed any of the ways that you're thinking about investing right now?

Beth Kindig: It has changed everything entirely, I would say.

Beth Kindig: 180-degree pivot toward how important macro, how important S&P 500 is even for tech investors because the S&P 500 is a culmination of many macro factors represented in one price movement basically. We actually, I would say the best analogy is that macro is in the driver's seat and we like to track the S&P 500 for that in terms of price movements. Bottom line is in the passenger seat and I would say growth is in the trunk of the car. That's how much growth has moved down in terms of importance.

We, at the I/O Fund, everything we do is actually macro-informed and we made that hard pivot back in April and May. If macro and S&P 500 is not participating, for example, we would not enter a stock. If S&P 500 stops participating, we would trim stocks and that's because macro is, like I said, truly in the driver's seat. We see that obviously when the Fed comes out and speaks, but at the same time, there's so much more underlying levels of uncertainty that need to be monitored. I would say the No. 1 would be the consumer actually we think is weaker than the market today is taking into account.

Deidre Woollard: Fascinating. Growth is in the trunk of the car that is a tectonic shift. You're talking about the consumer, but how does that impact some of the tech companies that you're seeing? I'm wondering about things like the cloud in terms of B2B, which then eventually becomes B2C. What are you seeing in terms of that?

Beth Kindig: Yes, that's a great question. In terms of growth being in the trunk, so to speak, we see that actually I think Meta had flat growth or negative growth by single digits and people are looking for that bottom line, etc. I think we've seen some evidence even already, of how little priority growth is being given. But in terms of your question with B2B and B2C, I think it's an excellent question because B2C budgets move faster. You could point toward many things that crashed ad-tech but the umbrella or the one common denominator is that ad budgets were greatly reduced and they are completely every single company doesn't matter if you have 2 billion users or just a couple of hundred million. If you're mobile, desktop, CTV, across the board, they were all penalized greatly due to how much budgets had come down.

Now, we're up against as cloud investors is cloud budgets which the enterprise move slower, They determine these budgets usually in the early part of the year. What I would say is most concerning about the cloud software slowdown is that enterprises were actually pulling budgets, reducing their budgets that they had already set for 2022 for Q4, that's a red flag really. What we could see is some exuberance, which is what we're seeing in the market now, I'm talking not respective to price action. I'm saying underneath the fundamentals are weak enough that eventually price will be adjusted long-term, whether we get an exuberant month or two in the market or not. That would be something to really closely watch, is why were budgets pulled.

"Texas Instruments: The Semiconductor Stock to Own This Decade
2023-01-29T11:45:00Z
Semiconductors -- the brains of our modern electronic and computing infrastructure -- have seen rapid growth over the past few decades. From cloud computing to artificial intelligence (AI) to smartphones, companies around the world are growing their need for semiconductors, presenting a huge opportunity for the manufacturers of these products.

Popular stocks within the industry are Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and AMD. All have put up great returns for shareholders, but I don't think any are the best semiconductor stock to buy for the long term. Here's why stalwart giant Texas Instruments (TXN -1.56%) is the best semiconductor stock to own this decade and beyond.

You may know the Texas Instruments (TI) brand from the extra large calculators used in schools, but the company's main business is manufacturing semiconductors. Specifically, it builds lagging-edge analog and embedded computer chips for the industrial, automotive, and personal-electronics markets. Lagging edge means that TI doesn't sell the latest and greatest technologies in the industry but has a reliable and diverse customer base for simpler products that belong in automobiles and factories.

Even though TI's products are generally older and have been in production for a while, there has been a growing demand for analog semiconductors to power two huge transformations: the digitization of factories and the electrification of the automotive market. Many factories and industrial systems are embracing sensors, software, and other tools throughout their complex systems to improve efficiencies.

For example, the digital twins market -- which means interactive digital copies of physical systems -- is projected to grow at a 37% annual rate through 2030. Many of the sensors and computer chips within these factories come from TI.

The electrification of the automotive market is a well-known phenomenon, thanks to Tesla and its famous CEO Elon Musk. Electric vehicles (EVs) are projected to make up over 50% of the global automotive fleet by 2030, which is a huge transition. What's little known about EVs is that they take many more semiconductors to operate than combustion-engine vehicles, providing a huge opportunity for companies like TI.

In order to grow into this demand, TI is planning to spend around $3 billion a year on capital expenditures this decade. That's a lot of money, compared to its current revenue of $20 billion. But with such a large opportunity ahead of it, TI looks poised to earn great returns on all this invested capital.

What's great about TI is it's not only a business with strong growth prospects, but it also has an executive team with a fantastic track record of capital allocation. From 2004 to 2021, TI raised its dividend every year, going from $0.09 to $4.60. The company has been a consistent purchaser of its own stock, reducing shares outstanding by 46% over that same time period.

According to management, the consistent buybacks and payout growth will continue this decade, improving the forward-return profile for TI shareholders.

No investment comes without risk, and I see two with TI stock at the moment. One is short term, and the other is long term.

In 2023, investors should be watching if customer demand wanes for TI. Even though its end markets are poised to grow over the long haul, the semiconductor market has gone through wild swings since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Last year, there was a huge shortage of semiconductor components in the automotive market, which caused TI to ramp up production as much as possible. It also contributed a lot to its growing top line. If this shortage turns into a semiconductor glut for the automotive market in 2023, TI's revenue could decline.

Over the long term -- and this is a much more important risk to watch -- TI will need to manage a CEO transition. Long-time CEO Rich Templeton just announced his resignation from the company, elevating president and 24-year company veteran Haviv Ilan to the position.

"2 Top Bargain Stocks Ready for a Bull Run
2023-02-09T10:05:00Z
The stock market is off to a terrific start in 2023, with the S&P 500 index gaining 8% so far. It would not be surprising to see the market head higher as the year progresses amid signs of a stabilizing U.S. economy and because of indications that the Federal Reserve is likely to slow the pace of interest rate hikes in response to cooling inflation.

This economic positivity is now being seen in the share prices of Meta Platforms (META -0.96%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -2.19%), popularly known as TSMC, as well. Meta stock is up a whopping 53% so far in 2023, while shares of foundry giant TSMC have jumped nearly 28% this year.

Even with the recent price jump, shares of both companies continue to trade at attractive levels. Let's look at the reasons why these tech stocks should be able to sustain this momentum and keep heading higher.

Meta Platforms' stock was in the doghouse for much of the past year, thanks to challenging conditions in the digital advertising space, but the company's latest quarterly results indicate that a turnaround is in the cards.

The Facebook parent's fourth-quarter 2022 results, which were released on Feb. 1, led to a 20% spike in its stock price in a single day. The company's results exceeded expectations, with revenue of $32.2 billion, beating the Wall Street estimate of $31.5 billion. Its adjusted earnings of $3 per share also eclipsed the $2.22-per-share consensus estimate.

Moreover, Meta's focus on keeping tight control of its expenses this year is expected to drive bottom-line growth. The company forecasts $92 billion in total expenses in 2023 at the midpoint of its guidance range, down from its prior expectation of $97 billion. Meta also lowered its capital expenditures estimate to a range of $30 billion to $33 billion from the earlier estimate of $34 billion to $37 billion.

Meta finished 2022 with $116.6 billion in revenue. The company's expenses increased a whopping 23% over 2021 to $87.6 billion, sending its earnings down 38% to $8.59 per share. Analysts anticipate a 5% jump in Meta's revenue this year to $122.4 billion, while the moves to control costs could send earnings to $9.25 per share. What's more, Meta Platforms is expected to witness further improvements in its top and bottom lines next year.

These estimates aren't surprising, as Meta faces easier comparisons in 2023. Digital ad spending growth had slowed down to 8.6% in 2022 to $567 billion following a 30% jump in 2021, according to eMarketer. Digital ad spending growth is expected to accelerate in 2023 to 10.5%, followed by an 11% increase in 2024, paving the way for Meta to boost its top line.

And given that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will focus on improving operational efficiency and reducing costs, the company's earnings are likely to head higher. That's why investors in the hunt for a cheap stock that could go on a bull run may want to buy Meta before it is too late.

The stock currently trades at 21.7 times earnings -- which is lower than the Nasdaq-100's multiple of 24.3 -- so investors are getting a good deal on Meta Platforms right now. They should consider capitalizing on that opportunity.

TSMC stock is already on a bull run, as its shares have shot up 52% in the past three months, but the good part is that it is still trading at just 14.6 times trailing earnings right now. The valuation makes TSMC stock a bargain that investors should consider buying hand over fist, even though the near-term prospects of the semiconductor market may appear to be bleak.

Gartner is estimating a 3.6% decline in the semiconductor industry's revenue this year to $596 billion. While that's not ideal for a foundry such as TSMC that makes chips for the likes of Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, and Apple, among others, investors would do well to focus on the bigger picture. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said on the company's January 2023 earnings conference call that the semiconductor market is set to recover in the second half of the year.

"These 5 ETFs Are a Retiree's Best Friends
2023-02-01T13:40:00Z
Investing in individual companies isn't for everyone; those looking to simplify their portfolios should consider exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Simply put, ETFs are a group of securities like stocks or bonds that trade under a single ticker symbol. Just like you can buy stocks in different types of companies, you can buy a variety of ETFs to build a diversified portfolio.

This is especially useful to retirees, who don't necessarily want to get too risky with their investing strategy or spend all of their time combing through stocks. Here are five great ETFs for retirees and conservative investors.

The S&P 500, which contains 500 of the biggest and best corporations in America, is the widely accepted benchmark for the stock market. So an ETF like the Vanguard 500 ETF (VOO -1.07%) is a great starting point for any portfolio. It's constructed to mimic the S&P 500 and carries a minimal expense ratio of 0.03%. In other words, owning the stock will cost just $0.30 annually for every $1,000 you invest.

Warren Buffett famously won a bet that a hedge fund couldn't outperform the S&P 500 over a 10-year period, so don't be shy about building your portfolio around it. The stock market has averaged roughly 10% in annual returns over its long history.

2. Adding some upside to your portfolio

Some investors may want a little more spark in their portfolio while still staying as simple as possible. The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ -1.67%) comes to mind as a great choice. This ETF is built around the Nasdaq-100, which focuses on large-cap growth stocks, often in the technology sector. The fund's top holdings include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia, which combine to make up about 40% of the ETF's holdings.

Big tech has been a big winner over the past decade, and the QQQ has outperformed the market in that time. That said, growth stocks tend to be volatile, so investors should prepared for the ups and downs that can accompany bear markets like the one in 2022. This ETF also has a higher expense ratio of 0.20%, though its historical returns arguably justify the higher cost.

3. Pay your living expenses with this ETF

Dividends can be a retiree's best friend; they're cash distributions paid to shareholders when a company shares its profits with investors. They can be reinvested or used to pay your living expenses. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM -0.37%) is one of the best dividend-paying ETFs. The fund has a generous dividend yield of almost 3% but charges a low expense ratio of just 0.06%.

The fund includes over 400 names, concentrated mainly in tried-and-true industries like energy, consumer staples, financials, and healthcare. It's not the flashiest fund you can buy, but you can count on a reliable dividend that beats any savings account at your local bank.

Owning real estate is one of humankind's oldest and most proven wealth-building tools. But buying real properties isn't as easy as playing Monopoly. Fortunately, you can benefit from real estate by owning the Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH -1.63%). This ETF is made up of various real estate investment trusts (REITs), companies specifically structured for owning real estate.

REITs are great dividend stocks, and this carries through to this ETF, which also pays a dividend yielding close to 3% as of this writing. Some of the fund's top holdings include blue chip REITs like American Tower Corporation, Realty Income, and Crown Castle. The fund is another low-cost option for investors with a 0.07% expense ratio.

5. Don't forget about adding bonds to your portfolio

Debt has long been a staple of the global economy, yet it is often overlooked as an investment. You can invest in debt through bonds, and the Vanguard Total World Bond ETF (BNDW -0.46%) is an excellent fund for beginners. The fund holds bonds of varying term lengths from all over the world. In other words, it's a catch-all of bonds to keep your portfolio diverse.

Bonds pay interest, meaning this ETF pays its shareholders dividends. The fund's current dividend yield is just over 2%. That's not super high, but it is high quality. After all, the best dividend is a paid dividend. The Total World Bond ETF gives you broad exposure to investment-grade debt worldwide, which is less likely to default

"Where Will Texas Instruments Stock Be in 1 Year?
2023-01-26T13:53:00Z
Texas Instruments' (TXN -1.56%) stock has stayed nearly flat over the past 12 months as the S&P 500 has declined 9%. The company also outperformed the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which slumped 15% as post-pandemic sales of new PCs and smartphones cooled off.

TI outperformed the chip sector because it was broadly diversified, it didn't have much exposure to the PC market, and it generated most of its growth from the auto and industrial sectors. Its gross margins held steady because it mainly sold analog and embedded chips, which are cheaper to produce than higher-end chips, and it consistently reduced its production costs by transitioning from 200mm to 300mm wafers (which lowered the costs of its unpackaged parts by about 40%).

TI's resilient business model enabled it to generate plenty of cash for dividends and buybacks. It has raised its dividend annually for 19 consecutive years, and it's bought back nearly half its shares over the past two decades. Those strengths made TI a safe haven investment as rising interest rates drove investors away from the tech sector's pricier and more speculative stocks. But will TI's stock continue to rise and outperform the S&P 500 over the next 12 months?

TI's growth has been a bit bumpy over the past five years. It suffered its last cyclical downturn in 2019 and 2020 as it struggled with slower sales of smartphones, softer sales of automotive and industrial chips, the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, and the COVID-19 pandemic. TI's growth subsequently accelerated in 2021 as new 5G devices arrived, the auto and industrial sectors recovered, and the market's soaring demand for new chips outstripped its available supply.

But in 2022, TI's revenue growth decelerated again throughout the first three quarters before slipping 3% year over year in the fourth quarter. It attributed that slowdown to ""weaker demand in all end markets with the exception of automotive,"" and it expects its revenue to drop another 8% to 15% year over year in the first quarter of 2023. For the full year, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to decline 8% and 16%, respectively.

How long will this cyclical downturn last?

In other words, 2023 could feel a lot like 2019 for TI's investors. TI's automotive chip sales should remain broadly stable as automakers install a higher number of analog and embedded chips in their connected vehicles, but the macro headwinds could cancel out those gains by curbing its sales of industrial chips. Together, the automotive and industrial markets accounted for 65% of TI's revenues in 2022, compared to 57% of its revenues in 2019.

TI's sales of chips for personal electronics (including smartphones), communications equipment, and enterprise systems could also remain sluggish in this tough macro environment. On the bright side, TI's sales in China -- which were throttled by ongoing COVID lockdowns throughout 2022 -- could recover in 2023 as the government loosens its draconian restrictions. TI also has another advantage: Unlike producers of more advanced chips like Intel (INTC -1.83%) and Nvidia, TI doesn't face any government-mandated restrictions on selling its chips to Chinese clients.

In addition, TI could benefit from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed last year and grants subsidies and tax breaks to integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) that manufacture their chips domestically. That financial aid could accelerate TI's expansion of its 300mm plants and boost its long-term margins. Lastly, many chipmakers -- including the industry bellwether Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -2.19%) -- expect the semiconductor market to bottom out in the first half of 2023 before recovering in the second half. That's why analysts expect TI's revenue and earnings to grow 7% and 8%, respectively, in 2024.

Where will TI's stock be in 12 months?

TI's growth should remain sluggish in the first half of 2023, but expectations for a recovery in 2024 should prevent investors from becoming too bearish. That said, TI's stock still isn't cheap at 22 times forward earnings, and its forward dividend yield of 2.9% probably won't attract any serious income investors when the 10-Year Treasury note pays a 3.5% yield.

"Investing in ChatGPT's AI Revolution: Where to Begin
2023-02-08T18:47:00Z
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the cat's meow right now. OpenAI's ChatGPT bot is the talk of the town as people from all walks of life are figuring out what this new tool can and can't do.

Crochet patterns for stuffed narwhals and guitar solos in E phrygian mode seem to be beyond ChatGPT's abilities so far, for example. But people have found the automated chatbot fun and useful enough to pose a threat to various long-established businesses. Above all, I keep hearing that AI services like ChatGPT could make web search obsolete. Microsoft (MSFT -2.18%) is already integrating this tool into its Bing search service in an attempt to challenge Alphabet 's (GOOG -1.89%) (GOOGL -1.94%) dominant Google platform.

Of course, it turned out that Google was working on something comparable to ChatGPT behind not-so-closed doors. We'll soon see how the Google Bard service compares to ChatGPT, In that announcement, Google CEO Sundar Pichai also claimed that many so-called generative AI applications are based on ideas from a research paper Google published in 2017.

So Microsoft and Google are facing off in the burgeoning AI industry, but that's far from the whole picture. Many other tech titans have AI systems of their own, including a few generative AI services in the style of ChatGPT and Bard. It's starting to feel like you can't call yourself a tech company unless you're doing something interesting with AI.

Here are a couple of tech giants with unique twists on the AI business. Their names might not immediately spring to mind when you're looking for AI investments, but maybe they should.

I'm sure you've heard of International Business Machines ' (IBM -0.17%) AI platform. It Deep Blue chess computer was the first machine to beat a human world champion on the classic 64 squares, way back in 1997. From there, Big Blue never abandoned its artificial intelligence pursuits.

The company's financial filings are peppered with references to ""IBM's hybrid cloud and AI strategy."" IBM has provided AI solutions for large businesses for many years under the Watson brand. In particular, management is excited about the long-term prospects of large language models for AI -- exactly the type of artificial intelligence that ChatGPT uses.

""For businesses, deploying AI can be challenging because it takes time to train each model,"" CEO Arvind Krishna said in January's fourth-quarter earnings call. ""But by using large language models, companies can now create multiple models using the same data set. This means businesses can deploy AI with a fraction of the time and resources. That is why we are investing in large language, our foundation models for our clients, and have infused these capabilities across our AI portfolio.""

Later in the same call, Krishna noted that AI systems are expected to add $16 trillion of global economic value by 2030. His company will approach that gigantic revenue stream from the perspective of enterprise-class business tools. That being said, some of those tools might look and feel a lot like ChatGPT.

""If we can help retirees get their pensions through interacting with a Watson-powered AI chatbot, that is an enterprise use case where all of these technologies come into play,"" Krishna said.

So IBM might not launch a consumer-oriented service like ChatGPT, but is already integrating similar tools into its enterprise offerings. It's already the future for Big Blue.

Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%) graphics processing units (GPUs) were originally designed to run 3-D games and other graphically rich computer programs, but these processors have found new use cases in the processing of large data volumes. The math used for creating realistic computer graphics turns out to be great at many other types of intense number-crunching.

Artificial intelligence is one of these auxiliary opportunities to put Nvidia's GPU horsepower to work. For instance, the A100 GPU was made for hyperscale data analytics. This chip offers market-leading performance for training large language models and other machine-learning systems.

"3 Things About Texas Instruments That Smart Investors Know
2023-02-01T10:15:00Z
Texas Instruments (TXN -1.56%) is often considered a safe long-term investment for conservative investors. Instead of developing expensive cutting-edge chips, TI only produces cheaper (albeit essential) analog and embedded chips for the automotive, industrial, personal electronics, communications infrastructure, and enterprise hardware markets.

Pumping out large quantities of those cheaper chips enabled TI to generate plenty of cash for big buybacks and dividends. That's how it reduced its share count by 48% over the past 20 years while raising its dividend annually for 19 consecutive years. Its stock has risen nearly 1,000% over the past 20 years and generated a total return of more than 1,500%.

Past performance never guarantees future gains, but TI's latest numbers suggest it still has plenty of room to run. I've already covered many aspects of TI's business before, but today I'll focus on three lesser-known facts about TI -- and what they can tell investors about the resilient chipmaker's past, present, and future.

1. It surrendered the mobile market to Qualcomm

TI didn't always produce cheap analog and embedded chips. Back in 2002, TI partnered with STMicroelectronics to develop a new series of Open Multimedia Applications Platform (OMAP) processors, which combined Arm-based CPUs with several specialized co-processors.

TI's OMAP chips were subsequently installed in Motorola's Droid phones, Amazon's Kindle Fire, Samsung's Galaxy Tab 2, and other tablets, but it struggled to keep pace with Qualcomm's Snapdragon system on chips (SoCs), which bundled together Arm-based CPUs, GPUs, and baseband modems in a single package. In 2012, TI shut down its entire consumer phone division.

TI's exit from mobile chips shaped its current strategy of only producing lower-end analog and embedded chips instead of higher-end application processors. That pivotal decision -- along with its ongoing transition from 200 mm to 300 mm wafers (which reduces its production costs by about 40%) -- caused its gross margin to soar over the past decade.

2. It will benefit from the CHIPS and Science Act

Last August, the Biden administration signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law and allocated $280 billion in new funding to the development and production of semiconductors in the United States. The package includes $52 billion in subsidies for chipmakers that build manufacturing plants within the U.S. and produce their chips domestically.

TI will benefit from those subsidies, since it's an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) that produces most of its chips at its domestic fabs. That makes it different from ""fabless"" chipmakers like Qualcomm and Nvidia, which outsource their production to third-party contract chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM).

Those subsidies could make it much easier for TI to ramp up the expansion of its 300 mm fabs. Last year, it said it would boost its capital expenditures to about $3.5 billion annually, or a mid-teens percentage of its revenue, over the following four years to upgrade those fabs. It also plans to keep its capex elevated at around 10% of its revenue from 2025 to 2030.

3. TSMC might not exist without Texas Instruments

Morris Chang, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, worked at TI for 25 years and became its global VP of semiconductors. But in his own words, Chang was ""put out to the pasture"" instead of being promoted to the C-suite. Chang eventually returned to Taiwan, led the government-funded Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), and founded TSMC in 1987. So if TI had simply promoted Chang to a top position, TSMC might not have become the contract chipmaking behemoth it is today. Analysts currently expect TSMC to generate more than four times as much revenue as TI this year.

That isn't surprising, since TSMC is now the world's largest contract chipmaker, while TI still generates all of its revenue from first-party chips. However, it's interesting to wonder what could have happened to TI if Chang had become its CEO in the 1980s. Would TI have evolved into a domestic contract chipmaking giant like TSMC -- which might have prevented the production of chips from going overseas -- or would it have still pivoted toward the production of cheaper first-party chips?

"Have $1,000? These 2 Stocks Could Be Bargain Buys for 2023 and Beyond
2023-02-20T14:36:43Z
The media often presents a barrage of complications for investors to think about every day, but the truth is successful investing is very simple. All you need to do is regularly buy shares of growing companies. It doesn't matter how much you start with, since compounding returns can take a small sum a long way over time.

The following companies not only have attractive long-term growth opportunities, but their stock prices are trading at bargain levels right now. Investors who put some extra cash -- say $1,000 -- into these two top stocks could double their money within the next five years.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -2.19%) is one of the largest chip foundries in the world. Some of the world's largest brands depend on TSMC to manufacture chips for their products, including Apple.

TSMC generated a high profit margin of 45% last year on $76 billion in revenue. This reflects the company's unique capabilities as a chip manufacturer to provide a large capacity to handle lots of orders, and its investments in cutting-edge technology. Because of these advantages, it can price its services to earn extraordinary profits, which ultimately drives returns for shareholders.

Over the last five years, revenue and profits more than doubled. At the start of 2022, TSMC said the industry was experiencing ""a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand underpinned by the industry megatrends of 5G-related and [high-performance computing] applications.""

However, the company recently hit a wall in growth due to slowing demand across the semiconductor industry relating to macroeconomic headwinds. Fourth-quarter fell slightly over the previous quarter, but the stock has fallen to its cheapest valuation in years.

With the stock trading at a conservative valuation of less than 16 times this year's earnings estimates, investors are getting an incredible value. A bet on TSMC is essentially a bet on continued development of smartphones, game consoles, data centers, and other markets using high-powered processors. It's a no-brainer.

TSMC has a solid competitive moat. For example, in 2022, leading graphics specialist Nvidia selected TSMC to manufacture processors for its latest graphics cards for gaming. Apple also tapped its services to supply chips for the latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. TSMC is clearly maintaining a strong leadership position in the industry, and that sets the company up for accelerating growth when the industry recovers.

Analysts currently expect TSMC to grow earnings at an annualized rate of 21% over the next five years. At that rate, the stock could continue trading at the same price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, but investors could potentially more than double their money from the increase in earnings.

Salesforce (CRM -1.17%) is another leader in enabling the digital transformation of the global economy that is offering great value to investors right now. Despite delivering consistent double-digit annual revenue growth for many years, this Dow stock is currently 22% cheaper than it was a year ago, making it an absolute bargain for growth investors.

The software company's Customer 360 platform is its bread-and-butter offering. Its investments in bringing together a suite of software tools to help businesses lower costs and more efficiently operate have made it the leader in the customer relationship management (CRM) market for nine consecutive years, according to IDC.

Wall Street analysts are aware of Salesforce's strengths, but the reason the stock fell last year is decelerating top-line growth. Revenue grew 14% year over year in the last quarter, which was caused by unfavorable currency changes and customers keeping a tighter leash on spending.

While double-digit top-line growth looks solid for most companies, it is weak by Salesforce's standards. Analysts are used to seeing this software powerhouse post 25% top-line growth every year, as it did over the last three years.

Salesforce will see its growth gradually slow over time as it becomes a larger business. But what's getting missed by Wall Street is Salesforce's pivot to improving profitability from its lucrative subscription-based business model.

"2 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in February
2023-02-03T14:21:00Z
It might not be a case of going from zero to hero, but the tech sector is rebounding smartly in 2023 following its drubbing last year. As investors shifted to more defensive positions, the sector tumbled hard, and many previous highfliers were in the dumps.

However, this year is shaping up as a different story, with tech stocks rallying to become one of the best-performing sectors in the early going. Sure, the new year is just one month old, but the gains are a welcome reprieve for many investors.

That should make now an excellent time to bring a set of hungry eyes to the sector, and there are two tech stock investors can confidently buy in February.

Lately, it has been either feast or famine for semiconductor stocks. Last year, the industry was working through a chip shortage brought on by the remnants of the pandemic that helped snarl supply chains; now, it seems chipmakers did their job too well and are suffering from a chip glut instead.

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM -2.19%) is the leading contract chip manufacturer for global tech companies, including Advanced Micro Devices, Apple, and Nvidia. TSM, as it is commonly called, is a pure-play foundry that hands off all the heavy-lifting design work to its customers. The company's sole focus is on chip production instead.

Yet, as the industry works through one of the most severe imbalances between supply and demand in memory chips in over a decade, TSM is confident the glut will ease in the back half of 2023, depending on the market. Smartphones could take longer, and data center chips could resolve themselves sooner. But with continued investment in next-gen chips that exceed what the competition is producing, TSM should be able to ensure its tech customers are always in a steady state of demand.

TSM stock is also comparatively cheap, going for around 13 times trailing and estimated earnings and at a fraction of its expected earnings growth rate. With a healthy dividend yielding 1.9% annually, this foundry stock is one to buy today.

Networking hardware and software giant Cisco Systems (CSCO -1.48%) also struggled last year with supply chain disruptions, part shortages, and higher freight costs that hit its secure and agile networks unit, which represents nearly half of its revenue.

Yet its fiscal first-quarter earnings report for the October-ending period suggested the worst of the situation was behind it as revenue jumped 12%, with even its end-to-end security and optimized applications segments enjoying new growth. Cisco will be reporting second-quarter results soon, and while investors should get a sense of whether the momentum will continue, there are reasonable indications it will.

Despite Cisco's core hardware business being highly commoditized, the tech giant has invested heavily in its software division, which offers higher growth. It has long maintained the full gamut of emerging trends such as hybrid cloud, webscale, Wi-Fi 6 and 400-gig solutions, hybrid work, cloud-native architectures, cloud security, 5G deployment, full-stack observability, the Internet of Things, and edge computing. These markets will drive Cisco's business in the future.

Cisco raised its full-year revenue outlook growth of 6.5% as it transitions to more software and subscription-based recurring revenue, and it believes it can achieve between 5% and 7% annual sales growth over the long term. It also forecasts that adjusted earnings will see up to 7% growth this year, and the market values it at just 13 times those expected profits, making Cisco's stock attractive.

Cisco has paid a dividend since 2011 that today offers an attractive forward yield of 3.2%. While the tech stock may not be the growth company it was during the 1990s, it has a substantial cash and short-term investment hoard of almost $20 billion that gives it a cushion and measure of stability, making it a solid pick nonetheless for investors looking for capital appreciation, reliable dividend payments, and stock buybacks."
"The Best Stocks to Invest $1,000 in Right Now
2023-02-03T12:00:00Z
If you've got some cash on the sidelines, you might be looking to deploy some now that the economic outlook has shifted into a more positive light. Even though the market has run up a bit in the past month, there are still plenty of stocks worth buying.

Here's my list of the five best stocks worth buying right now.

First is cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (CRWD -0.14%). Its cloud-based end point protection software secures network end points (like laptops and phones) and cloud workloads. Most businesses' cybersecurity solutions must be beefed up in the coming years, and CrowdStrike will significantly benefit from this spending wave.

Even now, CrowdStrike has seen impressive revenue growth, with annual recurring revenue rising 54% to $2.34 billion in its latest quarter. CrowdStrike also converts a high percentage of its revenue into free cash flow (FCF), posting a 30% margin in Q3 FY 2023 (ending Oct. 31).

With the stock trading for 43 times FCF, it is slightly pricey, but with its rapid growth pace and huge runway, it's a price investors should be willing to pay.

Airbnb (ABNB -2.18%) benefited from several trends, like working from home and staying in places other than hotels while traveling. Those trends have directly translated into Airbnb's financial results.

In Q3, Airbnb's revenue rose 29% to $2.9 billion, mainly due to 25% more nights and experiences being booked over last year. It also produced a record $1.2 billion in net income and generated $3.3 billion in free cash flow over the past year. Yet despite the excellent results and a management team that is optimistic about the future, the stock is still cheaply valued at 24 times FCF.

With the economic slowdown likely affecting consumers less than initially anticipated, Airbnb seems like a no-brainer buy at these levels.

Some occupations cannot function without the software needed to do daily jobs. For engineering and architecture, Autodesk's (ADSK -12.95%) products are necessary software expenses that cannot be cut. This makes Autodesk a fantastic investment, in good times and bad.

However, with Autodesk's revenue rising by 14% in its Q3 (ending Oct. 31), I'd say times are quite good at the company. It also produced a ton of free cash flow -- $460 million in the quarter, equating to a 36% margin.

Autodesk is planning on utilizing some of that FCF to repurchase shares, as the board of directors recently approved a $5 billion share repurchase plan. That's enough to repurchase about 11% of the company.

With the stock trading at a fairly valued 25 times FCF, investors can pick up shares of a company that will steadily grow regardless of economic conditions.

Few companies possess the technical skill and resources to implement cloud, cybersecurity, or other digital transformation initiatives. That's where the consulting expertise of Accenture (ACN -1.73%) comes in. By utilizing Accenture's services, a company has access to a vast team of experts that can create, implement, and maintain any solution it might need.

One fact investors need to know about Accenture is its global footprint -- it's headquartered in Ireland. This means converting revenues back into U.S. dollars isn't representative of what business success it saw. In its Q1 (ending Nov. 30), Accenture's revenues rose 15% in local currency and returned over $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

At 21 times FCF, Accenture is a solid buy and will see its services heavily utilized if its clients decide to reinvest in their own technological solutions now that the economic uncertainty is receding.

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM -2.19%) is one of the world's premier semiconductor foundries. While it doesn't market its chips, it produces those that go into Apple and Nvidia products (among many others), making it a great way to play the technological advancements these companies are making. It's also rolling out its 3 nm (nanometer) chip technology, which will be a huge revenue booster in the coming years.

"Is Intel a Value Stock or a Value Trap for 2023?
2023-01-31T13:33:00Z
Intel (INTC -1.83%) could not have kicked off 2023 in worse fashion. Its fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were near the bottom of the already not-great guidance it had provided a few months ago, and the first quarter of 2023 is going to be even uglier. Intel has a very difficult and expensive uphill battle ahead of it as it tries to catch up to its peers on multiple fronts.

By some metrics, Intel may actually appear like an incredible value at this point. Indeed, the stock price hasn't been this low in years and trades for less than 1.7 times trailing-12-month sales -- a meager metric that semiconductor stocks rarely trade for. But there are good reasons for the pessimism a would-be value hunter should be aware of, because Intel could very well be a value trap (a stock that looks cheap but isn't).

Intel's silver lining isn't much more than a consolation prize

Intel's Q4 2022 revenue and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (EPS) fell a respective 32% and 92% compared to a year ago. Things will get worse before they get better. Revenue, at the midpoint of guidance, will fall another 40% year over year in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted EPS will swing to negative $0.15, compared to positive $0.87 in Q1 2022.

CEO Pat Gelsinger and the top team also declined to provide any full-year 2023 guidance. While it somewhat echoed second-half 2023 optimism as the chip industry deals with excess inventory in PCs and laptops, it left open the possibility that full-year 2023 earnings and free cash flow could wind up being in the red. In other words, based on current and immediate-term profitability (or complete lack thereof in this case), Intel is no value stock.

Gelsinger and company have often pointed out (including on the last earnings call) that the company is rapidly improving its process manufacturing to catch up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -2.19%). I take issue with this, though. While Intel is indeed catching up to AMD (AMD -2.08%) with its designs for PC and laptop processors -- currently Intel's bread-and-butter -- it's terrible timing. Consumers are pulling back on computer spending in grand fashion. Market share gains for Intel, yes, but it's a shrinking market. Plus, there's also Apple (AAPL -1.80%) and its top-notch in-house design M-series chips for its MacBooks, which are clobbering Intel in computing performance.

And then there's the data center segment, where all the semiconductor industry growth is really to be had these days. Intel is still woefully behind and ceding market share here to AMD, which has dramatically shifted its focus away from consumer-facing products to emphasize enterprise chips for the cloud and data centers. While AMD and others grow in this department, Intel is in retreat.

Intel promises it will recapture its design and manufacturing leadership by 2025. Maybe it will. But that will be an expensive endeavor that will hinge on new (and incredibly expensive) equipment purchased from ASML (ASML -3.09%). Thus, I think Intel's most bullish silver lining from its recent investor updates is more of a nod to ASML than a boon to Intel.

Moving beyond Intel's top revenue segments, there appeared to be more good news from the Network and edge (NEX) segment, as well as from automotive technology chip subsidiary Mobileye. But not so fast!

Though the NEX segment held up relatively well in the last year (it reported record revenue in 2022), Intel is in cost-cutting mode to try and shore up its withering profit margins. In its search for cash, it has decided to cut future investments into NEX -- specifically its network-switching portfolio. Unfortunately, in the world of chip design, stopping investment in research and development is essentially waving the flag in surrender.

The investment cut apparently includes the Tofino ethernet switch chips, which trace their roots to a small acquisition in 2019. But even in this department, Intel is lagging behind the competition from the likes of Broadcom, Marvell Technology Group, and more recent entries into the space like Nvidia, which acquired network switching specialist Mellanox in early 2020.

"Interview With David Rolfe of Wedgewood Partners
2023-02-17T20:48:00Z
David Rolfe is the chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Wedgewood Partners. Under his leadership, Wedgewood was named a separately managed account (SMA) manager of the year in both 2011 and 2013. He writes some of the most thorough quarterly investing letters I'm aware of and those letters (and Wedgewood's investment performance) are included in the Investment Masters Class website. Wedgewood letters have also been honored by Professor Lawrence Cunningham in his journal article ""Lessons from Quality Shareholders."" David has been a featured guest on CNBC and Barron's, and he will be presenting at the Guru Investing Conference in Omaha this May.

What follows is a recent interview I conducted with David over email.

John Rotonti: Tell us about Wedgewood Partners. (David, here you can keep it high level into things like where you are located, whether you are a value or growth investing firm, whether you manage a concentrated or diverse portfolio, assets under management [AUM] if you want, when you were founded, anything else you want.)

David Rolfe: Wedgewood Partners was founded in 1988 by our chairman, Tony Guerrerio. Our strategy was incepted 30 years ago in 1992 when I joined Wedgewood as chief investment officer. I am also the architect of our strategy that I started at my previous firm of employ back in 1988. In addition to our large-cap focused-growth strategy, we also offer a focused SMID strategy we stared in the summer of 2018. We currently manage $1.2 billion.

Our firm's leaders, on both the investment and business front, have spent many years, if not decades in the investment management industry. Our investment team is also quite rare in the industry in that our three-decade-long track record is not a compilation of different CIOs and different senior investment professionals or different investment teams. Our investment team includes Tony Guerrerio, Michael Quigley, and Chris Jersan. With Wedgewood, you invest with the key people who actually built the firm's leading 30 year-track record.

Rotonti: What is your investing philosophy? What types of businesses do you try to buy stock in?

Rolfe: Our firm's large-cap focused-growth strategy is based on what we call ""The Competitive Advantage of Focus."" Our 30-plus years of peer and index outperformance is due to the competitive advantage of our focused strategy. We believe that focus is our edge. And that edge is repeatable.

The powerful combination of a disciplined culture of investing for the true long term in best-of-breed businesses, combined with the synthesis of the time-tested, classic tenets of both growth company investing and intelligent value investing is a recipe for long-term wealth creation, as well as peer and index outperformance.

Rolfe: Our investment philosophy begins where so many other non-focused managers finish. Our investment universe is the Russell 1000 Growth index. There are currently 519 stocks in that Index. We also include the best businesses in the S&P 500 index. We begin our investment process by identifying best-in-class business models. In that search, we look to measures of past excellence, in terms of both profitability and growth. At this point, the first question the team collectively asks is, ""Can we understand the business model's past drivers of that profitability, growth, and management's capital allocation?"" Going through this process typically reduces our universe by about 80%. Once we get to this point on about 100 companies, we ask ourselves a second question: ""Can we understand the business model's competitive advantages well enough to be confident on what the business model will look like over the next 5-10 years?"" This second question cuts our universe in half down to around 40 business models. The third question we ask ourselves are actually a series of questions on portfolio management. These involve matters of catalysts, valuation, risk management and actual portfolio construction.

The key to our investment philosophy and strategy of building a focused, 20-stock portfolio, in order to beat our benchmark and peers, is risk management. I can't emphasize this enough -- risk management pervades our entire strategy, from security analysis to portfolio construction to portfolio management.

"RingCentral (RNG) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-02-16T05:00:24Z
Good afternoon, and welcome to the RingCentral fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Will Wong.

Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to RingCentral's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. I'm Will Wong, VP of investor relations. Joining me today are Vlad Shmunis, founder, chairman, and CEO; Mo Katibeh, president and chief operating officer; and Sonalee Parekh, chief financial officer.

Our format today will include prepared remarks by Vlad, Mo, and Sonali, followed by Q&A. We also have a slide presentation available on our investor relations website that will coincide with today's call, which you can find under the financial results section at ir.ringcentral.com. Some of our discussion and responses to your questions will contain forward-looking statements regarding the company's business operations, financial performance, and outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control and are not guarantees of future performance.

Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to our business, please refer to the information contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as today's earnings release. Unless otherwise indicated, all measures that follow are non-GAAP with year-over-year comparisons. A reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided with our earnings release and in the slide deck.

For certain forward-looking guidance, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available, as discussed in detail in the slide deck posted on our investor relations website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Vlad.

Thanks, Will. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings conference call. 2022 was a milestone year for RingCentral. I am very proud of what our team has achieved against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop.

The strength and resilience of our business model and stickiness of our customer base allowed us to once again deliver on our guidance. Let me give you a few facts regarding 2022. One, we finished the year with $2.1 billion of annual recurring revenue. We are now one of only 10 pure-play SaaS companies with over $2 billion of recurring revenue and greater than 80% subscription gross margin.

Two, we exited the year with a record operating margin of 14%, which is up over 300 basis points versus last year. Three, Contact Center is now approximately a $300 million ARR business, which we believe makes us a top five global CCaaS provider. And four, most importantly, we still invested over $0.25 billion in product and technology, further cementing our market leadership position. And going from strength to strength, in 2022, RingCentral received over 30 workplace and employer brand awards.

We were honored to be included among best companies for diversity, women, and company culture. This allowed us to build a world-class team as we attracted top-notch senior executive talent from companies such as Google, Adobe, AWS, NVIDIA, and Five9. Building on this solid foundation, we expect continued growth and improving customer acquisition costs, resulting in strong operating margin expansion. We have also made significant progress driving down SBC as a percent of revenue by almost 400 basis points in 2022, and we expect continued improvements in this area going forward.

All this puts us on a path to significantly stronger free cash flows, which, combined with our new credit facility, puts us well on our way toward addressing our outstanding converts. Mo and Sonalee will provide more detail about our results and outlook shortly. But before they do, let me remind you of the main drivers of our success. It comes down to our corporate values: trust, innovation, and partnerships.

"Tesla (TSLA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-01-26T05:30:27Z
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's fourth quarter 2022 Q&A webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of investor relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.

During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. [Operator instructions] But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.

Thank you, Martin. So '22 -- just going through the '22 recap. It was a fantastic year for Tesla. It was our best year ever on every level.

Team did an amazing job. It's an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people. So in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highest among any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker. While doing so, we generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash flow.

Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records while -- despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates and many delivery challenges. So it's worth noting that all these records were in the face of massive difficulties. Credit to the team for achieving that. The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand.

Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest. Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history. We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production. So I mean, that -- it's hard to say whether that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high.

And we've actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that. So we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole. So basically, price really matters. I think there's just a vast number of people that want to buy a Tesla car but can't afford it.

And so, these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer. And sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how important affordability is. And it's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible so I'm glad that we're able to do so. And yes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered.

We're also making very good progress on cost control. And we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with the growth in production, as you'd expect, so yes. With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed Full Self-Driving Beta to -- for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy.

And we're currently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways. And our published data shows that improvement in safety -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear. So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent. Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday.

Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers. So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers. Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time. So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells.

"Intel (INTC) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-01-27T02:00:22Z
Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Intel Corporation's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, corporate vice president of investor relations.

Thank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, Dave Zinsner.

In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. As such, it does involve risks and uncertainties. Our press release provides more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.

We've also provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures this quarter, and we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings release and earnings presentation include full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.

Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 revenue came in at the low end of guide and was impacted by persistent macro headwinds, which began in Q2 and underscored a 2022 characterized by unprecedented volatility, which will continue in the near term. We made meaningful progress on several fronts in calendar year '22, notwithstanding all the challenges, but we readily admit our results and our Q1 guidance are below what we expect of ourselves. We are working diligently to address the challenges brought on by current demand trends and remain confident in our long-term plans and trajectory.

Accordingly, we are even more aggressively executing on the cost measures we described in Q3 even as we keep the investments critical to our long-term transformation intact with a clear eye of making the right capital allocation decision to drive the most long-term value. Today, I'd like to address three areas. One, our view on the macro and the markets in which we participate; two, the operational progress we made in 2022; three, as we enter the new year outlining the commitments we are making to all our stakeholders. First, on the macro.

We expect macro weakness to persist at least through the first half of the year with the possibility of second half improvements. However, given the uncertainty in the current environment, we are not going to provide revenue guidance beyond Q1. Dave will provide guidelines for capital spending, depreciation and adjusted free cash flow in his prepared comments. Having said that, let me give you additional color regarding our view of our markets in 2023.

To various degrees, all our markets are being impacted by macro uncertainty, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions in Europe and COVID impacts in Asia, especially in China. In the PC market, we saw a further deterioration as we ended calendar year '22. In Q3, we provided an estimate for the calendar year '23 PC consumption TAM of 270 million to 295 million units. Given continued uncertainty and demand signals we see in Q1, we expect the lower end of that range is a more likely outcome.

Near term, the PC ecosystem continues to deplete inventory. For all of calendar year '22, our sell-in was roughly 10% below consumption with Q4 under shipping meaningfully higher than full year, and Q1 expected to grow again to represent the most significant inventory digestion in our data set. While we know this dynamic will need to reverse, predicting one is difficult. Importantly, PC usage data remains strong, reinforcing that use cases brought on by COVID are persistent even as the economy has reopened.

And as we highlighted in our recent PC webinar, strong usage and installed base, which is roughly 10% higher than pre-COVID levels and what we see as a conservative refresh rate supports a longer-term PC TAM of 300 million units plus or minus, post this period of adjustment. We intend to capitalize on this TAM through a strong pipeline of innovation and based on the growing strength of our product portfolio, customers are increasingly betting on Intel. We grew share in the second half of '22, and we expect that positive momentum to continue in '23. We remain clear eyed on managing to near-term weakness in PCs but we also see the enduring and increasing value PCs have in our daily lives.

"Stumbling Intel, seeing AMD gain ground, says it will recover balance - Reuters.com

OAKLAND, Calif/BANGALORE, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Microprocessor giant Intel Corp (INTC.O) says it will regain its footing against AMD and other chip rivals which are gobbling up market share, but Wall Street is skeptical.

The company shocked the market on Thursday with a revenue outlook that was short of Wall Street estimates by about $3 billion. The challenge from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) is playing out as tech spending slumps globally, complicating Intel's efforts to clear a record inventory glut.

Intel is still the 300-pound gorilla in the market of microprocessors, called central processing units (CPUs), the brains of computers. It says it has passed through the worst of a revamp under a new chief executive.

""We lost share, we lost momentum. We think that stabilizes this year,"" Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told investors on a conference call.

However, business tech spending is falling sharply as customers are wary of a recession, and consumer electronics demand has slumped after surging through the COVID-19 pandemic. That's a headwind for Intel and AMD, both of which are rolling out new chips, but Intel is facing a larger inventory correction.

The company reported $13.2 billion in inventories, equal to about 151 days of inventory, according to Bernstein analysts.

Intel still dominates the markets for PC and server processing chips, with a market share greater than 70%, tech research firm IDC calculated. But that is down from more than 90% in 2017.

""I don't think Intel is in a position yet to start recovering share. Someone going from 1% to 13% is significant. It tells you that now there's a viable second competitor in the server processor market, who has momentum and is gaining momentum,"" said Rau.

That competitor is AMD, which under the leadership of Chief Executive Lisa Su has come back from the brink of bankruptcy and has been taking business away from Intel quarter after quarter.

A few years ago, there was a yawning gap between the two company's market valuations. Now, they are both roughly valued at $120 billion, even though AMD's revenues for the 12 months through September were $22.8 billion, far short of Intel's $70 billion. AMD reports results next Tuesday.

Chipmaker shares were hammered across the board on Friday, but Intel led the decline, slumping by 10% while AMD lost 1.8%.

Purchasers of processors cannot launch products if new chip designs are late, and Intel has stumbled on delivering its latest data-center chip, code-named Sapphire Rapids.

""Intel had high hopes that Sapphire Rapids would enable them to take the fight to AMD,"" said Lucas Keh, semiconductors analyst at Third Bridge. ""However, our experts say that it has been a disappointment so far because of Intel’s continuous inconsistency in delivery.""

Worse for Intel, the benchmarks published by the two companies show that AMD's latest server chip outperforms Sapphire Rapids on ""general purpose workloads,"" according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.

Intel has other rising competitors, too. Graphics chip maker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) is branching out into central processors and former processor customers, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), are designing their own chips.

CEO Gelsinger said that 2023 would be a year of stabilizing then re-acceleration. Intel had taken some painful steps and now needed to execute on a good plan, he said.

""Intel's turnaround is taking some time, exacerbated by the economy, but I believe its plan is working,"" said Glenn O'Donnell, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""It is delivering on new products and its manufacturing is ramping up with agreements from other chipmakers to use Intel's manufacturing capacity.""

"Intel's 'historic collapse' sparks selloff in chip stocks - Reuters.com
2023-01-27T12:24:00Z
Jan 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) saw about $8 billion wiped off its market value on Friday after the U.S. chipmaker stumped Wall Street with dismal earnings projections, fanning fears around a slump in the personal-computer market.

The company predicted a surprise loss for the first quarter and its revenue forecast was $3 billion below estimates as it also struggled with slowing growth in the data center business.

Intel shares closed 6.4% lower, while rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) ended the session up 0.3% and 2.8%, respectively. Intel supplier KLA Corp (KLAC.O) settled 6.9% lower after its dismal forecast.

""No words can portray or explain the historic collapse of Intel,"" said Rosenblatt Securities' Hans Mosesmann, who was among the 21 analysts to cut their price targets on the stock.

The poor outlook underscored the challenges facing Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger as he tries to reestablish Intel's dominance of the sector by expanding contract manufacturing and building new factories in the United States and Europe.

The company has been steadily losing market share to rivals like AMD, which has used contract chipmakers such as Taiwan-based TSMC (2330.TW) to make chips that outpace Intel's technology.

""AMD's Genoa and Bergamo (data center) chips have a strong price-performance advantage compared to Intel's Sapphire Rapids processors, which should drive further AMD share gains,"" said Matt Wegner, analyst at YipitData.

Analysts said that puts Intel at a disadvantage even when the data center market bottoms out, expected in the second half of 2022, as the company would have lost even more share by then.

""It is now clear why Intel needs to cut so much cost as the company's original plans prove to be fantasy,"" brokerage Bernstein said.

""The magnitude of the deterioration is stunning, and brings potential concern to the company's cash position over time.""

Intel, which plans to cut $3 billion in costs this year, generated $7.7 billion in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and paid dividends of $1.5 billion.

With capital expenditure estimated to be around $20 billion in 2023, analysts said the company should consider cutting its dividend.

"The Ratings Game: Nvidia’s stock could win big amid ‘AI arms race,’ says BofA analyst
2023-02-14T17:10:00Z
Instead of placing bets on which software companies will rise to the top in artificial-intelligence-powered search, perhaps investors should look below the surface.

BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya is upbeat about Nvidia Corp.’s NVDA, ability to capitalize on the push that companies are making to bake artificial intelligence into their offerings — a push that has become frenzied thanks to the recent success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Read: AI is dominating the action in the stock market right now

“[Nvidia’s] full-stack of accelerated silicon/systems/software/developers positions it uniquely to lead the nascent generative AI arms race among global cloud and enterprise customers,” Arya wrote in a Monday note to clients.

Nvidia is a “top compute pick” for Arya, and he’s feeling even more bullish lately. He upped his price objective to $255 from $215 Monday while maintaining a buy rating, “as AI adoption potentially catalyzes long-term data center growth.”

He expects that generative AI will increase to $62 billion the total addressable market for accelerators, which can help process AI tasks more efficiently and deliver “near-instantaneous results.”

Even if you pump the brakes on the current mania around generative AI, which is the type of AI that ChatGPT represents, Nvidia still looks poised to benefit from a broader wave of interest in the category, in his view.

“Generative AI is in its requisite hype cycle and predicting its adoption pace involves lots of assumptions,” Arya wrote. “Regardless, the shift to accelerated computing, led by [Nvidia] GPU, and away from conventional CPUs is structural, with accelerator sales growing at a 42% pace in last 5 years vs just 6% for CPUs.”

Shares of Nvidia were up 2.6% in late morning trading Tuesday.

Nvidia isn’t the only potential beneficiary. Other possible winners include Synopsys Inc. SNPS, and Cadence Design Systems Inc. CDNS, in electronic design automation (EDA), as well as Marvell Technology Inc. MRVL, and Broadcom Inc. AVGO, when it comes to networking of high-bandwidth accelerated services.

“The emergence of AI could represent one of the strongest upcoming drivers for semis,” Arya wrote. “Computational requirements for running AI models are quickly changing, and so are costs related to running those models.”"

"Google, Microsoft and the threat from overmighty trustbusters
2023-02-09T10:53:13Z
T mergers to worry about and mergers to welcome. In the first category are tie-ups between biggish firms in the same line of business. In these “horizontal” mergers, a competitor is taken out of the market, removing a constraint on prices. In such cases, competition authorities will investigate the merger and may block it. Other mergers have historically been considered less troublesome. If a firm buys another in an adjacent line of business (a conglomerate merger) or if a supplier buys a customer (a vertical merger), the effects on competition have been seen as benign.

But that has changed in recent years. More and more non-horizontal mergers are being challenged by antitrust authorities. In September America’s Federal Trade Commission ( ) lost its challenge in court to a tie-up between Illumina, which provides “next-generation” -sequencing tools, and Grail, a developer of early cancer-detection tests, which rely on Illumina’s technology. The is appealing the judgment. In October Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority ( ) forced Facebook to undo its purchase of Giphy, a supplier of s to social-media platforms. On February 8th, the issued an initial finding that the acquisition by Microsoft, maker of the Xbox games console, of Activision Blizzard, a game studio, would reduce competition in the industry.

Vigorous antitrust policy is often motivated by anxiety about big tech. Facebook, Google and Microsoft became swiftly dominant in their markets because of the power of networks: the more people used their products, the better they became and the more attractive they were to other customers. Although it is difficult to find fault with such organic growth on competition grounds, there is a conviction in trustbuster circles that big tech should not have been allowed to buy other businesses along the way. The recent regulatory activism is therefore fuelled by regret about the past. Yet it carries its own risks. In many circumstances mergers are, in fact, a boon to consumers. The danger now is that the pendulum will swing towards over-enforcement.

To understand how regulators got to this point, it is worth returning to the 1970s. A group of antitrust thinkers orbiting the University of Chicago cast doubt on the idea that vertical mergers could be harmful by employing the theory of “one monopoly profit”. This theory says that a monopolist cannot extend its market power up or down the vertical chain of production. To grasp it, imagine an airport operator that leases space to two coffee shops. The operator owns a monopoly resource: the property around a captive market of passengers who require their morning caffeine. To maximise profits, it will set the rents high enough to allow the shops no more than a competitive return. Yet were the operator to buy one of the coffee retailers, the profit-maximising rent would not change (hence one monopoly profit).

Looked at this way, vertical mergers cannot harm consumers. They may even help them. A related theory posits that a vertical merger in an industry where there is some market power at each stage of production will lead to lower prices, because one of the non-competitive markups will be eliminated. In such circumstances, one monopoly profit means you don’t get gouged twice.

Trustbusters these days are less focused on pricing. They are more concerned that a vertically integrated firm will use its muscle in one part of the chain to freeze out rivals in another part. In the Illumina case, the concern is that rivals of Grail will be denied the -sequencing tools they need to develop competing cancer tests. In the Microsoft case, the fear is that Sony, maker of PlayStation, the rival console to Xbox, will be denied games made by Activision, to the detriment of competition. To make the charge stick, trustbusters must demonstrate that such restrictions would be profitable, which they are unlikely to be in the short term, since they mean at least initially selling fewer products. Regulators thus have to make predictions about how a market might evolve. This is the economic equivalent of long-range weather forecasting.

"Distributed Ledger: Why bitcoin is up 40% in January despite crypto industry carnage. Can the rally continue?
2023-01-26T19:56:00Z
Welcome back to Distributed Ledger. This is Frances Yue, crypto reporter at MarketWatch.

Bitcoin has had a stellar start this year, with an almost 40% rise so far, even though crypto lender Genesis filed for bankruptcy last week, only months after digital asset exchange FTX imploded in November. In this installment, I’ll break down what’s driving the largest cryptocurrency’s rally.

Find me on Twitter at @FrancesYue_ to share any thoughts on crypto, this newsletter, or your personal stories with digital assets.

It is not only crypto – most markets tend to perform well in January, as fund managers rush to deploy money at the start of a year, according to Ivan Ivanchenko, managing partner at Phinom Digital. In fact, most risk assets rose so far this year, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite logging a 8.8% gain, according to FactSet data.

Meanwhile, bitcoin was heavily shorted in November and December after FTX’s collapse. As the crypto’s price rose unexpectedly in January, some short sellers were forced to close their positions and buy bitcoin, pushing the crypto’s price even higher.

Bitcoin’s rise also comes as investors’ confidence picked up, noted Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at crypto derivatives exchange Deribit.

After FTX’s implosion in November, the number of open contracts for bitcoin futures and options on Deribit reached the highest level in history, indicating a high level of activity, noted Strijers. “That’s because people were anticipating the worst which requires a need for them to hedge their holdings to protect more downside moves,” Strijers told Distributed Ledger in an interview.

The fear and panic in the crypto market may be easing slightly in January, with several signals in the derivatives market suggesting a comeback of institutional interest. The spot price of bitcoin is lower than the futures prices, showing that traders believe bitcoin’s price will rise, according to data from several exchanges.

In addition, there are more call options trading in the market than put options, signaling a rise in bullish sentiment, noted Strijers. Call options allow traders to buy an asset at a predetermined price, while put options allow traders to sell an asset at a predetermined price.

Despite the recent rally, Phinom’s Ivanchenko expects further downside for bitcoin, which may fall below its previous low of $15,480, said Ivanchenko. “I prefer to think of the market right now as having more risks than opportunities,” Ivanchenko said. “We don’t know the weakness of certain links.”

The macroeconomic environment remains challenging, with still high inflation and a possible recession on the way at least in the U.S. It is also unclear how Genesis’s bankruptcy may spill over to other companies, including its corporate parent Digital Currency Group and its sister company Grayscale Investments, which owns the world’s largest bitcoin fund GBTC, noted Ivanchenko.

Read: Jeremy Grantham says ‘easiest leg’ of stock-market bubble burst is over. Here’s what’s next.

Meanwhile, after several major crypto companies’ collapsed last year, “regulators can push the market to new lows, easily,” said Ivanchenko.

Deribit’s Strijers holds a different view. He expects the rally to continue with a market in a “recovery mode.”

The impact of the implosions of FTX and Genesis on most large crypto companies are already known and priced in, noted Strijers. “I think that people realize it, and the Genesis problem even though bad and unsettled, is manageable,” said Strijers.

Tesla didn’t buy or sell any bitcoins in the fourth quarter of 2022, though the largest cryptocurrency fell to a two-year low of $15,480 in November, after FTX filed for bankruptcy. Tesla invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin in early 2021, when the crypto was trading above $30,000.

Still, the electric car maker recorded a $34 million impairment loss in the fourth quarter, recording the value of its digital asset holdings at $184 million on Dec. 31, down from $218 million on Sept. 30.

"Your Evening Briefing: Key Fed-Favored Measure Shows Cooling Inflation
2023-01-27T23:46:33Z
The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measures eased in December to the slowest annual pace in over a year while consumer spending fell, helping pave the way for policymakers to further scale back interest-rate hikes. The figures added to mounting evidence that the worst bout of inflation in a generation has passed as the Fed’s aggressive tightening campaign works its way through the economy. Officials are widely expected to once again slow the pace of rate hikes, to a quarter point next week, and will discuss how much higher they need to go to ensure prices are cooling for good.

But as always, there’s bad news, too. Another key gauge of the health of the American economy is showing stress. There’s a growing cohort of Americans facing auto repossessions, often an ominous sign. During the pandemic, a surge in used car prices forced buyers to take out bigger loans for their vehicles. The monthly payments may have been more manageable amid lockdown bailout checks, a tight labor market and surging stocks. But that’s changing for many people as inflation, though cooling, eats into their budgets."
"Distributed Ledger: These crypto-related stocks rallied up to 200% this year. Here’s why
2023-02-02T21:04:00Z
Welcome back to Distributed Ledger. This is Frances Yue, crypto reporter at MarketWatch.

Crypto miners have had a remarkable start of this year, as bitcoin BTCUSD, rose to around $24,000 from below $17,000 in early January.

Meanwhile, Dogecoin DOGEUSD, rallied, as Elon Musk is reportedly pushing forward Twitter’s payments system and considering adding crypto in it.

But Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, called for a crypto ban in the U.S.

Find me on Twitter at @FrancesYue_ to share any thoughts on crypto, this newsletter, or your personal stories with digital assets.

Bitcoin mining stocks are soaring, after suffering from a rough year in 2022 thanks to lofty energy costs, lackluster bitcoin prices and the elevated mining difficulty.

Riot Platforms Inc. RIOT, shares rose about 119% so far this year, and its rival Marathon Digital Holdings MARA, shares surged 132% over the same period. Ebang International Holdings Inc. EBON, saw its shares up almost 200% year-to-date. Hive Blockchain Technologies HIVE, shares jumped 183%, and Hut 8 Mining Corp. HUT, advanced 179% since the start of the year.

The rally echoed the upswing of other risk assets – the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, went up 16% so far this year. It could also be attributed to an improvement of crypto miners’ fundamentals, analysts said.

As bitcoin went up 45% from the start of the year, miners have seen their profit margin widen considerably, according to Andy Long, chief executive at White Rock Management. “Margins were super tight in December. A lot of miners had production costs that were getting unpleasantly close to the price of the coin,” Long told Distributed Ledger in a call.

Meanwhile, though the difficulty of mining bitcoin has risen to an all-time high as of Wednesday, it hasn’t increased as much as some miners expected, noted Long.

Mining difficulty measures how hard it is to find a bitcoin block – when the number goes up, miners have to put in more computational power to mine a coin. The difficulty level is programmed to increase when there are more miners, and vice versa, to keep the pace of bitcoin mining steady.

Global energy prices, which skyrocketed last year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have also fallen, in part thanks to a relatively mild winter in Europe and the continent’s conservation efforts. “We’re looking forward to maybe a more peaceful summer in terms of energy pricing,” noted Long.

Phil Harvey, chief executive at Sabre56, said though he doesn’t think the bear market is over yet, most miners would see a breakeven or make profits as long as bitcoin trades above $18,000.

Quote of the week

Munger slammed crypto again, this time in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. He blamed the “wretched excess” of cryptocurrencies that are issued by privately owned companies but later become publicly traded without government pre-approval of disclosures, and suggested the U.S. should follow China to ban crypto.

Sometimes, large chunks of crypto are sold to a promoter for low prices and inflated when the public buys in “without fully understanding the pre-dilution in favor of the promoter,” Munger wrote.

Dogecoin gained 9.6% in the past seven days, as the Financial Times reported Monday that Twitter has been advancing its efforts to build a payments system and crypto may be part of it.

Twitter has been applying regulatory licenses and devising the software it needed to enable payments through the site, the report said. Musk expects the payment system to use fiat currencies first, but be built so that crypto functionality could potentially be added at a later point, according to the report, citing anonymous sources.

The news revived some crypto enthusiasts’ hope that the social media giant would provide more use cases for digital assets, especially for the meme token Dogecoin, of which Musk is a longtime backer.

Bitcoin prices rose 3.9% during the past week, and was trading at around $23,848 on Thursday, according to CoinDesk data. Ether ETHUSD, gained 3.8% over the same stretch to around $1,678, CoinDesk data shows.

"Just how bad were holiday sales? The world’s biggest retailers are about to tell us
2023-02-20T18:16:00Z
The nation’s retailers limped into last year’s holiday season with too much stuff that people didn’t want. We’re about to find out how much of it they were able to get rid of, and how much an avalanche of markdowns hurt profits.

Results from the likes of Walmart Inc. WMT, , Home Depot Inc. HD, and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, will follow last year’s massive retail inventory mess, which found retail chains sitting on clothing, electronics and toys that they had a hard time selling, after inflation siphoned away demand to groceries and other basics. Retailers rolled out big price cuts on many nonfood items in an effort to entice customers.

Analysts generally say that the bigger the chain, the bigger the advantage in that environment. That’s particularly true if that retailer happens to sell groceries.

But results in the third quarter for the biggest big-box retailers — Walmart and Target Corp. TGT, , which both sell a lot of groceries — were mixed. Target, in November, said it expected fourth-quarter same-store sales to fall. However, Walmart managed to fare better at that time. And analysts still like Walmart’s odds, comparatively, ahead of its results.

“We expect continued momentum in grocery to help offset challenges in the general merchandise category,” Oppenheimer analysts said of Walmart in a research note this month.

However, as MarketWatch recently reported, holiday-season data from Placer.ai, a retail consumer-traffic analytics firm, wasn’t exactly encouraging.

“The strength of 2021 made for difficult year-over-year comparisons, as pent-up demand, accumulated savings and an early start drove an unusually robust season in 2021, so assessing the success of 2022’s holiday season is challenging,” Placer.ai said in a blog post.

“Visits to Target, Walmart, Costco, BJ’s Wholesale, and Sam’s Club were down in October and November 2022 relative to 2021, likely a result of comparisons to last year’s extended season,” the post continued.

Trends improved somewhat in December. But the firm suggested a more sluggish January, as pressures from higher prices held firm.

“Still, traffic data does seem to indicate that the economic difficulties of 2022 have begun to take a toll on consumers – January visits were down for almost all superstore chains analyzed, with the exception of Target that seems to be continuing its winning streak in the new year,” according to the post.

Results elsewhere will flesh out the story for the broader e-commerce slump and a stalling housing industry. Home Depot’s results will likely touch on consumer appetites for home improvement, as investors retreat from the housing market amid rising rates. Online retailers eBay Inc. EBAY, , Etsy Inc. ETSY, , Overstock.com Inc. OSTK, and Wayfair Inc. W, , which recently announced it would cut 10% of its workforce, report after Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, this month put up its least profitable holiday quarter since 2014.

The consumer discretionary sector has been among those leading the S&P 500 in profit declines, according to a FactSet report published on Friday. However, Amazon is largely responsible for that sector’s declines.

Sixty-one S&P 500 SPX, companies report results during this holiday-shortened week, including two components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, , according to FactSet.

Outside the major indexes, struggling fake-meat maker Beyond Meat Inc. BYND, also reports, as it cuts staff and deals with an onslaught of competition — from rivals churning out their own imitation meat and those making the real stuff.

"The Ratings Game: Nvidia’s stock-market hot streak is far from over, according to Wall Street analysts
2023-02-23T19:22:00Z
Nvidia Corp.’s stock has been a massive outperformer lately, and the company’s latest results suggest to some analysts that the run-up is not finished.

Taking into account a 12% Thursday gain as of midday, Nvidia shares NVDA, are up 59% this year, as the S&P 500 SPX, has risen about 4% and the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, has rallied 16%.

“In hindsight, we acknowledge that our decision to remain on the sidelines in anticipation of a pullback in the company’s fundamentals was wrong,” Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari wrote as he upgraded Nvidia’s stock to buy from neutral Thursday.

He added that “the combination of positive estimate revisions and a potential

expansion in the stock’s multiple — consistent with historical recovery phases — will drive continued outperformance in the stock.”

Hari is increasingly upbeat about Nvidia’s opportunity in artificial intelligence, a key topic of conversation on Wednesday afternoon’s earnings call.

“Given the recent emergence and potential proliferation of generative AI, we envision the rate of Nvidia’s wallet-share growth within the context of overall cloud [capital expenditures] accelerating in the near to medium term,” Hari wrote.

Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon also sees more room to rally for Nvidia shares. “Given the run the stock has had we believe many were nervous into the print, but the results seem to bolster the set-up from here which seems good at this point,” Rasgon wrote. “Tactically, following the results investors can now buy the stock at the start of a datacenter ramp, with a strong (and roughly normalized) gaming trajectory.”

Rasgon also noted that “there are further elements now starting to emerge that can let longer-term investors dream the dream,” including opportunities in AI software and Mercedes automotive software.

He rates Nvidia’s stock outperform and bumped his price target up to $265 from $200.

Arcuri wrote that UBS has “long said that NVDA is a product-cycle stock,” and it now is “on the cusp of what might be the strongest new-product cycles and [total addressable market] expansion in the history of the company.”

He allowed that “other derivative ways to play AI” exist but said that none of those come close to Nvidia. UBS is maintaining a buy rating on the stock and keeping a $270 share-price target intact.

Opinion: Nvidia speeds past a pothole, and AI offers extra fuel for the road ahead

Of the 45 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Nvidia’s stock, 30 have buy ratings on it, while 13 have hold ratings, and two have sell ratings. The average share-price target is $238.09.

One of the sidelined analysts, Matt Bryson of Wedbush, didn’t change his neutral rating despite seeing “a lot to like” in the latest Nvidia numbers.

“We remain very optimistic around the company’s longer-term opportunity and [its] positioning in its core markets, but are somewhat wary of the high valuation, particularly in light of a difficult macro backdrop,” he wrote.

"Microsoft just became the hottest name in AI, but Google, NVIDIA, IBM and other rivals are turning up the heat
2023-02-16T12:20:00Z
The hottest name in AI? Microsoft MSFT, . With its recent investment in OpenAI, best known for its chatbot ChatGPT3 that is taking the world by storm, Microsoft has shown its commitment to leading the age of artificial intelligence.

With all the headlines about Microsoft’s rapid ascent in AI, it isn’t a surprise that investors are excited about its prospects. With Microsoft’s Bing sitting at around 7% of the search market, Microsoft shared with investors recently that it estimated an additional $2 billion a year in revenue per 1% gain in market share. That’s a massive opportunity for Microsoft.

Yet demand for AI is expected to grow at close to a 20% compound annual growth rate, and Microsoft isn’t the only bet for investors looking to ride the AI wave long-term.

Here are three more companies making significant AI investments that investors should follow.

Alphabet: If Microsoft was the winner of the past few weeks, it was mainly at Alphabet’s GOOGL, Google’s expense. But anyone calling the Microsoft vs. Google race over at this point is doing so at their own risk.

While Microsoft is on the front foot and has showed off some incredible technology — putting Google’s search empire at risk for the first time in more than two decades, don’t expect Google to stand still and wait for Microsoft to take significant market share.

Instead, the company announced Bard, its next-generation ChatGPT competitor, and is beginning a wave of announcements to contest the recent Microsoft updates. Google has been actively investing in breakthrough AI for its search and cloud businesses, and while it may be forced to speed up its development and product launches, it is hard to imagine that Google doesn’t come up with an AI story that investors take seriously.

ServiceNow: ServiceNow NOW, sits in a great position. The need for workflow automation, which continues to be more AI-infused, will only gain momentum as businesses pour more resources into their digital transformation projects.

In the past, automation was about scripted processes that could be repeated with code. In the future, workflows will be fluid and self-improving to enable businesses to leverage larger data sets to streamline almost every business function. Furthermore, ServiceNow’s platform has the flexibility to act as an orchestration layer across diverse and complicated enterprise IT environments. AI will make this capability more pronounced and less complex for enterprises and will be a catalyst for further growth.

NVIDIA: No other company has been as closely linked to being the enabler of AI in recent years as NVIDIA NVDA, . The company has been building the full stack of building blocks for AI, including the hardware, software, and frameworks required for training and inference in consumer and enterprise applications.

In many ways, the ability of programmers to leverage the power of GPUs has been supercharged by NVIDIA. This has enabled AI-powered innovations in gaming, automotive, data center and more. The practical development of the metaverse, such as building digital twins for automotive engineers, is leveraging a combination of NVIDIA hardware and software, including its Omniverse tools, which will undoubtedly be critical to the future of immersive digital experiences.

This only scratches the surface of NVIDIA’s contributions to AI. From its recommendation engines to its conversational AI models, NVIDIA undoubtedly will continue to be a core holding for investors wanting to play in the AI space. Furthermore, its stock price is well-below its 2021 highs, providing significant potential upside as tech comes back in vogue.

IBM: Big Blue IBM, stock has seen a significant run over the past year, with AI being one of its two major catalysts. The company is fully committed to AI as its path to sustainable growth.

Oracle: Oracle’s ORCL, massive business dataset enables it to build prebuilt AI models to deliver scalable business insights. It’s early days for Oracle AI, but it’s hard not to see solid mid- to long-term upside.

"Earnings Outlook: Nvidia earnings overshadowed by Microsoft, ChatGPT, OpenAI, 10-year gaming partnership
2023-02-21T21:11:00Z
Nvidia Corp. earnings received a warmup Tuesday as Microsoft Corp. and the graphics-processing-unit giant announced a 10-year partnership to bring Activision Blizzard Inc.’s catalog as well as Xbox games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service GeForce Now.

That redirects focus on Nvidia’s NVDA, data-center sales and the contribution from public cloud providers like Microsoft’s MSFT, Azure. In late January, Microsoft also announced a new investment into OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, as well as plans to deploy the startup’s AI tech across its services.

Read: What is ChatGPT? Well, you can ask it yourself.

UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised his price target to $270 from $200 and kept his buy rating, saying he remains “very optimistic about the longer-term generative AI opportunity and both the hardware/software [total-addressable market] that is opened up as [Nvidia’s graphics processing unit] Hopper is really the only viable solution for training these massive models — ‘longer-term’ is the key though.”

"Tech stocks have made money this year, but many investors are convinced they’ll get burned if they buy into the rally now
2023-02-01T12:18:00Z
Microsoft kicked off a slate of technology earnings earlier this week, reporting largely solid numbers that could have quickly been deemed a victory for technology stocks overall if not for CEO Satya Nadella’s cautious guidance. Investors surmised that the technology sector broadly could be in for some hard knocks — even after its impressive January bounce.

While Microsoft MSFT, has been a bellwether for growth over the past few years, it, along with its FAANG compatriots, including Amazon.com AMZN, , Apple AAPL, and Alphabet GOOGL, , are under close watch. Recession headlines and the hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve are headwinds for the technology sector and delay its recovery. A wave of layoffs has also raised questions about tech’s near-term strength. No surprise that the markets are trying to determine whether a bottom is in, and a return to growth names is a real option.

This could be an opportunistic moment for tech companies to get ready for the growth cycle. Tech will be back, and we’re seeing positive signs of that now. While devices, peripherals, and semiconductors look to have a longer road back, some big players have stood out during this earnings season so far — with mixed market reactions. Here are some to watch:

ServiceNow: NOW, A beat and raise for the fourth quarter with strength across the board. I’ve called this one for some time, and nothing has changed. ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott’s confidence in the company mid- to long-term continues to be evident in both results and guidance.

I spoke with McDermott on the company’s earnings day. He is convinced that even as the U.S. economy slows, companies won’t stop investing in technology. They will seek to do more with technology under hiring and revenue growth constraints. Automation, analytics, AI and the cloud will be paramount to efficient execution, and ServiceNow effectively ticks all those boxes.

IBM: IBM, IBM was another name I had expressed bullishness about over the past few quarters due to its strong enterprise ties and critical capabilities to enable businesses to do more with their current technology. CEO Arvind Krishna has been on the record recently, claiming that technology will grow 2%-4% faster than GDP in the coming periods and that IT will be the most protected line item in any enterprise budget.

This sentiment is readily justifiable because in a current period of cost-cutting measures not only in tech but in most industries, technology’s deflationary properties will drive material costs out of other parts of businesses, leaving technology to pick up the slack. For example, the trend toward enterprise investment in Hybrid Cloud and AI, IBM’s key focal areas, is gaining momentum. In a conversation with CFO Jim Kavanagh, he shared that in the fourth quarter of 2022, IBM saw margins improve, foreign-exchange challenges soften, albeit slightly, and most importantly, revenue accelerate.

Intel: INTC, There’s been no shortage of skeptics around Intel’s prospects, and the market reiterated its sentiment in response to Intel’s fourth-quarter slate. A brief conversation I had this week with CEO Pat Gelsinger gave both the good and the bad for the company, pointing to the back half of 2023 when a positive turn is most likely.

Most investors knew that 2022’s fourth quarter was tough for Intel. The ramp of its newest data center server chips (Sapphire Rapids) was a hopeful footnote, but as the numbers showed, it would take more time to impact Intel’s prospects fully. The company is in a multiyear turnaround to regain technology leadership and market share it has ceded to competitors including AMD AMD, and Arm .

Still, Intel is said to be on time with its commitment to delivering its next four processes in three years, a huge commitment that Gelsinger has led since taking the helm as CEO. Furthermore, the company has seen good momentum in its Foundry business, which was a bright spot in an overall rough set of earnings results. With policymakers pushing for more manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S., Intel likely will be a huge beneficiary.

"AMD, Nvidia, and 2 More Chip Stocks to Buy for 2023, According to an Analyst
2023-01-25T19:50:00Z
Mizuho says there are number of semiconductor stocks that offer buying opportunities for solid gains this year.

In a note to clients on Wednesday, analyst Vijay Rakesh recommended Advanced Micro Devices (ticker: AMD ), Nvidia (NVDA), Qualcomm ( QCOM ) and Broadcom (AVGO) as his top ideas for 2023. He has a Buy rating on all the companies.

The analyst has a $95 price target for AMD stock and a target of $200 for Nvidia , while Qualcomm’s target is $150. For Broadcom , his stock price forecast is $700. Rakesh noted over last two decades the semiconductor sector has declined in consecutive years only twice. The iShares Semiconductor (ticker: SOXX) exchange-traded fund, which tracks the performance of the ICE Semiconductor Index, dived 35% last year. In early trading Wednesday, AMD stock traded down 1.8% to $73.37; Nvidia shares fell by 2% to $188.75; Qualcomm stock declined 1.1% to $129.32; and Broadcom dropped 0.6% to $581.73. Every weekday evening we highlight the consequential market news of the day and explain what's likely to matter tomorrow. For AMD, the analyst is optimistic about its data center server chip business and predicts it can outperform current expectations. He is bullish on Nvidia’s market leadership in making chips that are used for artificial intelligence applications and expects its latest gaming graphics cards will sell well. Regarding Qualcomm, Rakesh sees the chip maker as a beneficiary from the eventual economic rebound in China. Finally, Broadcom shares are attractive on the back of its high profit margins across its semiconductor and infrastructure software portfolio, says the analyst."

"Outside the Box: Microsoft just became the hottest name in AI, but Google, NVIDIA, IBM and other rivals are turning up the heat
2023-02-16T12:20:00Z
The hottest name in AI? Microsoft MSFT, . With its recent investment in OpenAI, best known for its chatbot ChatGPT3 that is taking the world by storm, Microsoft has shown its commitment to leading the age of artificial intelligence.

With all the headlines about Microsoft’s rapid ascent in AI, it isn’t a surprise that investors are excited about its prospects. With Microsoft’s Bing sitting at around 7% of the search market, Microsoft shared with investors recently that it estimated an additional $2 billion a year in revenue per 1% gain in market share. That’s a massive opportunity for Microsoft.

Yet demand for AI is expected to grow at close to a 20% compound annual growth rate, and Microsoft isn’t the only bet for investors looking to ride the AI wave long-term.

Here are three more companies making significant AI investments that investors should follow.

Alphabet: If Microsoft was the winner of the past few weeks, it was mainly at Alphabet’s GOOGL, Google’s expense. But anyone calling the Microsoft vs. Google race over at this point is doing so at their own risk.

While Microsoft is on the front foot and has showed off some incredible technology — putting Google’s search empire at risk for the first time in more than two decades, don’t expect Google to stand still and wait for Microsoft to take significant market share.

Instead, the company announced Bard, its next-generation ChatGPT competitor, and is beginning a wave of announcements to contest the recent Microsoft updates. Google has been actively investing in breakthrough AI for its search and cloud businesses, and while it may be forced to speed up its development and product launches, it is hard to imagine that Google doesn’t come up with an AI story that investors take seriously.

ServiceNow: ServiceNow NOW, sits in a great position. The need for workflow automation, which continues to be more AI-infused, will only gain momentum as businesses pour more resources into their digital transformation projects.

In the past, automation was about scripted processes that could be repeated with code. In the future, workflows will be fluid and self-improving to enable businesses to leverage larger data sets to streamline almost every business function. Furthermore, ServiceNow’s platform has the flexibility to act as an orchestration layer across diverse and complicated enterprise IT environments. AI will make this capability more pronounced and less complex for enterprises and will be a catalyst for further growth.

NVIDIA: No other company has been as closely linked to being the enabler of AI in recent years as NVIDIA NVDA, . The company has been building the full stack of building blocks for AI, including the hardware, software, and frameworks required for training and inference in consumer and enterprise applications.

In many ways, the ability of programmers to leverage the power of GPUs has been supercharged by NVIDIA. This has enabled AI-powered innovations in gaming, automotive, data center and more. The practical development of the metaverse, such as building digital twins for automotive engineers, is leveraging a combination of NVIDIA hardware and software, including its Omniverse tools, which will undoubtedly be critical to the future of immersive digital experiences.

This only scratches the surface of NVIDIA’s contributions to AI. From its recommendation engines to its conversational AI models, NVIDIA undoubtedly will continue to be a core holding for investors wanting to play in the AI space. Furthermore, its stock price is well-below its 2021 highs, providing significant potential upside as tech comes back in vogue.

IBM: Big Blue IBM, stock has seen a significant run over the past year, with AI being one of its two major catalysts. The company is fully committed to AI as its path to sustainable growth.

Oracle: Oracle’s ORCL, massive business dataset enables it to build prebuilt AI models to deliver scalable business insights. It’s early days for Oracle AI, but it’s hard not to see solid mid- to long-term upside.

"Need to Know: Here’s why one technical analyst says the stock market is due a bounce after the 697-point sell-off in the Dow
2023-02-22T11:34:00Z
Thud. Investors returned from a three-day break on Tuesday in a pessimistic mood, as the S&P 500 SPX, saw its biggest drop of the year.

The latest slide on Wall Street has left the stock market at “important support” but one which should provide a “reversal back higher,” according to a closely watched research boutique.

In a note to clients published late Tuesday, Fundstrat’s head of technical strategy Mark Newton said technical factors and the end of a rally in bond yields should help stocks recover ground in the short term.

“The near-term decline in [the S&P 500] has now closed in on important support, which should likely provide a possible low to this pullback sometime over the final three days of this short week,” Newton wrote.

He noted the low volume during Tuesday’s slide, which suggested the desire to dump stocks was limited. The S&P 500 remains up 4.1% in 2023.

“Despite SPX having logged the worst trading day performance-wise in over two months’ time, volume was sub-par. While many blame the shortened holiday week for this lack of volume spike, one would think that volume would be at least a bit more than average on the worst trading day of the year,” said Newton.

Other technical factors may also provide assistance to equity bulls.

“[P]rices are now hovering right above the all-important 50% retracement area of the prior low to high range. Additionally, this week represents a 50% time retracement of the prior low to high swing from late December 2022,” he said.

“Thus, some short-term price and time confluence is approaching,” Newton wrote.

Given that the market continues to be led by moves in government bond markets — reflecting expectations of Federal Reserve monetary policy trajectory — any retracement in yields will also underpin stocks, he said.

“Treasuries look to have sold off in a near-perfect 5-wave decline from 1/19/23, which means that this bounce in yields also should be nearing completion.”

However, Newton accepted that further declines will make stocks even more vulnerable.

“Only if SPX undercuts 3945 would I fear that a larger decline might be in store. (For those that wish to give this rally a bit more slack, 3900 should also be important.) Such a move would involve slicing back under the 200-day moving average in SPX as well as undercutting the 61.8% retracement zone of the prior low to high range. Finally, this would also involve breaking the larger uptrend from last October’s lows.”

The Chart Report’s Patrick Dunuwila made a similar point about what would happen if stocks fell further. He described Tuesday’s action as a classic “failed breakout.”

“As we know, failed breakouts are often followed by sharp moves lower. If you’re feeling a sense of déjà vu, it’s because most of the major declines over the past year started off this way,” said Dunuwila. Traders will now watch to see if the S&P 500 can hold at 3,900 – 3,950, as a break below that “would likely bring more bears out of hibernation,” he says.

Stocks DJIA, SPX, COMP, are modestly higher, a day after the Dow’s nearly 700-point plunge, while the 2-year Treasury TMUBMUSD02Y, yield is pulling back, and oil prices CL.1, BRN00, are down.

"Bitcoin dips, but it may have already entered a bull market, based on these metrics
2023-02-09T21:01:00Z
Welcome back to Distributed Ledger. This is Frances Yue, crypto reporter at MarketWatch.

Bitcoin may have already entered a bull market, despite the carnage of the crypto industry, according to Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner at Pantera Capital.

Meanwhile, crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group reportedly has been selling shares in several crypto trusts run by its subsidiary Grayscale at a deep discount.

Coinbase’s CEO suggested that he’d been hearing rumors that regulators would like to get rid of crypto staking, and decried such a possibility.

Find me on Twitter at @FrancesYue_ to share any thoughts on crypto, this newsletter, or your personal stories with digital assets.

Bitcoin lost over 4% Thursday, falling below $22,000 to the lowest level in three weeks, down 68% from its all-time high, according to CoinDesk data. Still, its 37% rally so far this year may have marked the start of a new bull market cycle, according to Pantera’s Morehead.

Morehead wrote in a Wednesday note that the most recent bear market for bitcoin started in November 2021 and ended in November 2022, lasting for 376 days, while the median length of bitcoin’s previous bear cycles stands at 307 days.

Meanwhile, the median drawdown for bitcoin has been 73%, while during the most recent bear market, the crypto lost 77% of its value from the all-time high, according to Morehead.

The recent bear market has also been the only one that wiped out all the gain from the previous bull market, and resulted in even greater losses, noted Morehead.

To be sure, crypto traders are watching for more potential fallouts from the collapses of Genesis and FTX, while uncertainty remains in the macroeconomic environment, with a still high inflation and risks of a U.S. recession.

For the past few years, bitcoin has been often trading in tandem with stocks, especially growth stocks, crushing some of its supporters’ hope that the crypto could be seen as a hedge against inflation.

However, John Haar, managing director at Swan bitcoin and a former Goldman Sachs veteran, said the narrative may still hold, but it may be too late to buy bitcoin for this reason given inflation has already peaked in the U.S.

Bitcoin, which has a limited supply of 21 million, is a hedge against expansionary monetary policy, which often leads to an increased inflation levels, Haar said.

“If someone waits until the day that CPI is going up to buy Bitcoin, they have likely waited too long because monetary expansion often causes consumer prices to go up on a lag basis,” noted Haar.

Bitcoin climbed as the Federal Reserve started easing its monetary policy after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, and has fallen from its all-time high in November 2021 as the central bank started tapering its large asset-purchase programs and raised interest rates.

Crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group reportedly has been selling shares in several crypto trusts run by its subsidiary Grayscale at a deep discount, as it strives to raise money to repay creditors of its bankrupt lending arm Genesi, according to a report by the Financial Times this week.

It is one of DCG’s latest efforts to raise money to help Genesis repay over $3.5 billion to its creditors. DCG is both the parent company and a debtor to Genesis.

DCG has sold about a quarter of its shares in the Grayscale ethereum trust ETHE, to raise as much as $22 million in several trades since January 24, according to the FT report citing U.S. securities filings.

“This is simply part of our ongoing portfolio rebalancing,” DCG told the Financial Times. A company spokesperson declined to comment further to MarketWatch.

DCG has also been selling smaller blocks of shares in Grayscale’s Litecoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Classic Trust, and Digital Large Cap Fund, the report said.

A ban on crypto staking by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would be a “terrible path” for the industry, said Brian Armstrong, chief executive and co-founder of crypto exchange Coinbase.

"The Tell: Meme-stock era record falls: Retail traders dumped $1.5 billion a day into U.S. equities in January
2023-02-17T20:20:00Z
Retail traders bought up U.S. stocks at the fastest pace ever recorded in January, as inflows from traders using electronic brokerages surpassed the previous peak from the height of the meme-stock craze in 2021 according to data from Vanda Research.

After shunning stocks for the safety of money-market funds last year, retail traders poured an average of $1.51 billion per day into the U.S. equity market last month on a net basis, with buyers snapping up shares of some of their favorite megacap names like Tesla Inc. TSLA, and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, .

Their buying coincided with a surge in U.S. equity prices after the major U.S. indexes recorded double-digit declines in 2022. The Nasdaq Composite, home to many retail favorites, surged nearly 11% during January, its best month since November 2020, according to FactSet data.

The previous peak in retail inflows occurred started in January 2021 and continued into early February of that year, just as prices of GameStop Corp. GME, , AMC Inc. AMC, and other meme stocks soared to what were then record highs, a representative for Vanda Research said.

Tesla saw the highest volume of retail buying by dollar amount, with net inflows of more than $9.7 billion, as investors seized the opportunity to buy up shares after they declined in value by more than 65% last year, according to FactSet data. Other popular names were the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, , Amazon.com AMZN, , Apple Inc. AAPL, and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA,

Many highly speculative tech stocks with much smaller market capitalizations, including the Ark Innovation ETF ARKK, and many of its holdings, also made an appearance on Vanda’s list of most popular retail names.

While March and April are typically tepid months for retail buying as the fourth-quarter earnings season comes to a close and investors focus on paying their taxes, Vanda showed small-time investors still have plenty of money in reserve to pour back into equities.

“…[R]etail investors have plenty of dry powder in the form of capital parked in money market funds that could be deployed in the equity space once confidence about future market returns increases more broadly,” the Vanda Research team said in a note.

Once written off as marginal players in an equity market dominated by professional traders, individual investors have played an increasingly important role in markets ever since popular electronic discount brokerages dropped commissions in late 2019 to compete with Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD,

The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic a few months later created a perfect storm, as millions of Americans invested their government stimulus money in stocks while others turned to day trading to alleviate the boredom of being stuck at home.

The trend culminated with retail buyers pouring into stocks like GameStop Corp. GME, and AMC Inc. AMC, kick-starting the meme-stock craze and showing that retail traders can drive major swings in markets.

In fact, retail buying appears to have played a significant role in the January rally, as many of their favorite names also ranked among the market’s top performers. Retail interest could be one reason why many highly speculative names like Carvana Co. CVNA, and Coinbase Global Inc. COIN, saw high volume.

“Many smaller-cap single stocks are also beginning to populate the top part of the retail leaderboard so far in 2023,” the Vanda team said.

Carvana is up 139% so far this year, while Coinbase has risen 80%. Tesla is up 67.3% year to date and rose more than 40% in January, according to FactSet data. Meta Platforms Inc. META, , which fell by more than 64% last year, rallied by 23.79% in January as retail investors poured $780 million into the company’s stock."

While data shows individual investors dusting themselves off and moving back into the stock market this year, alas their love for Wall Street is uneven.

That’s according to Vanda Research, which points out that while retail investor inflows into U.S. stocks are at levels last seen in 2020-21, the move has has been dominated by Tesla Inc. TSLA, , whose shares saw their worst-ever performance in 2022, and stocks exposed to a hot new technology.

“Tesla shares are experiencing an unprecedented surge in demand, and to a lesser extent, so are artificial intelligence-related stocks like NVDA and AI, as well as the rest of FAANG group,” said Marco Iachini, senior vice president, Giacomo Pierantoni, head of data and Lucas Mantle, data science analyst, in a Thursday note, using ticker symbols for Nvidia Corp. NVDA, and C3.ai Inc. AI, .

Read: These 20 AI stocks are expected by analysts to rise up to 85% over the next year

“If flows into cash equities sustain the current pace, we believe there is scope for the more speculative retail traders to pick up the slack in the options market too — where activity has been muted over the last year,” said the team in a note to clients.

That said, the analysts see fear of missing out (FOMO) and momentum driving flows, making the situation different from early 2021 and leaving individual investors “susceptible to negative catalysts.”

“That said, should macro conditions remain favorable in the near term, we do not exclude a continuation of speculative activity in AI-related stocks or other niches of the market,” said the Vanda Research team.

Major stock indexes have bounced strongly to begin 2023, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, up nearly 15%, while the S&P 500 SPX, has bounced 8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, has gained 3.2%.

JPMorgan reported last month that retail market orders as a percent of market value reached 23% on Jan. 23, which compares the 22% seen a few times back when GameStop shares GME, started soaring and Roaring Kitty and Reddit Wall Street Bets was the talk of the watercooler in early 2021.

Markets are also seeing a rebound in total trading turnover, versus the second half of last year when stable daily net buying was accompanied by declining trading volume as investors focused on disciplined longer-term buying. The bounceback suggests improved risk appetite and “option volumes could pick up next, albeit not to the same extent, given that a large share of the WSB/degen crowd is likely still licking their wounds from 2022,” said the Vanda team, referring to the popular wallstreetbets Reddit forum.

In order to see trading expand beyond Tesla and AI stocks, they said the market needed to see continued U.S. economic resilience and particpation by “fast money discretionary managers,” along with more buying by mutual funds and pensions.

In the meantime, hopes for a soft landing and not-too-hot, not-too-cold economy is likely to keep the money flowing. That lines up with insights from JPMorgan, who noted significant participation lately by older investors, who will likely keep buying stocks and bonds unless optimism over inflation fades.

According to JPMorgan, older investors, who tend to invest via exchange traded funds, have injected $81 billion into bond funds and $44 billion into equity funds so far in 2023, against last year when they sold “unprecedented $340 bilion of bond funds and bought no equity funds,” said strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.

As for Tesla flows, Vanda Research noted that in the latest week, the EV maker drew a 24% and 33% share of single stock and overall net purchases across all U.S. securities, respectively. While they see investors “chasing momentum in the stock aiming to recoup 2022 losses,” the gains also come as hopes build ahead of Tesla’s March 1 investor day.

As for AI (artificial intelligence) related stocks, in a week that has delivered news on chatbots from Alphabet’s Google GOOGL, , Microsoft MSFT, and Baidu BIDU, , the Vanda team noted large retail net inflows over the last few days continued to flow into C3.ai, though that has begun to slow some. Retail investors are also sticking money into related small-cap stocks, such as BigBear.ai BBAI, or SoundHound AI SOUN, .

"Alphabet and Other Stocks That Are Solid Bets in a Wild Market

Markets have surged to start 2023, and leadership has shifted. Growth is outperforming value, risky stocks are trouncing defensive ones, and shares of Meta Platforms and Nvidia are leaving those of Northrop Grumman and Pfizer in their dust. It’s a whole new investing world compared with 2022, one that’s left investors wondering whether to chase the new winners or stick with the old ones.

There are plenty of reasons to worry. Inflation and interest rates aren’t heading back to the zero-bound soon, stocks are still expensive—the S&P 500 price/earnings multiple has expanded to 18 times from 15 over the past four months—and index-level profit growth in 2023 is far from guaranteed, even though analysts continue to rosily predict a solid increase."

"Investors beware. It’s the market relationship with data that may pivot when the Fed pauses, says Citi.
2023-01-27T11:53:00Z
Stocks on Friday looked ready to retreat a smidgeon as Wall Street closes out the week.

That’s OK, the S&P 500 SPX, is already up 5.75% in 2023, helped by the belief that slowing economy and softening inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive in raising borrowing costs.

This has meant that somewhat poor economic data is generally well received by equity investors. (Catastrophically bad economic news may be a different matter!).

That correlation may be put to the test again next week when the Fed is expected to deliver a 25 basis point rate hike, followed by a press conference with Chairman Jay Powell.

But stock bulls who hope to find signals the central bank will soon stop tightening policy may wish to think again. That’s the warning from Citi’s quantitative global macro strategist Alex Saunders, who says investors must brace for a shift in market responses.

“U.S. equity market reaction to economic surprises right now is that bad news is good for markets. This is one of the best regimes for U.S. equities. This correlation between news flow and equity markets is typical during hiking cycles,” he says.

Saunders studied Citi’s economic surprise index and its relationship to stock market action, and overlaid that with the monetary policy cycle.

The chart below shows the mean returns in four regimes. The best regime, says Saunders, is with positive economic surprises, and a positive equity/surprise correlation, which happens 34% of the time.

The worst outcome is when the market gets good economic news and equity/bond correlations are negative, which happens 18% of the time.

However: “The current reading on Citi’s economic surprises index is -15 and the correlation between surprises and returns is negative – markets have tended to react positively to a weaker surprise index.”

The likely reason is equities seek relief from the end of hiking cycles.

But this relation tends to flip once the Fed goes on hold, “As the hiking cycle matures, the correlation between economic surprises and U.S. equity market performance could turn positive. In this case, weak economic data from a likely 2H U.S. recession would weigh on markets”.

Such a transition to a regime where bad news is bad news “could be the sign that the bear market rally is fading -– for example, the sell-off after weak retail sales numbers earlier this month”.

In fact, Saunders can see the market painting itself into a corner.

“Additionally, a string of positive economic releases would also give us pause in equities, as the Fed could see this as a green light to tighten financial conditions further,” he says.

“The narrow path for equities is either to continue trading bad news in hope of a Fed pivot, or for recession fears to completely recede, inflation to continue falling, and good economic news to become good market news again,” he concludes.

Onto our call of the day, from Goldman Sachs who say they flat forecast for the S&P 500 SPX, this year — ending at 4,000 (their short-term target recently went higher) means it’s likely to be a profitable year for stock pickers and active managers. And as recession threats ease, the stock market is increasingly influenced by micro, or company specific factors.

A less macro driven market has in the past meant higher return dispersion — a wide range of returns, with stocks not moving in lockstep. And 43% of stockpicking large cap mutual funds have outperformed their benchmarks year to date, point out a Goldman team led by chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin.

And a softer economic landing and flat S&P 500 returns, will favor those stock pickers who try to generate more excess return on an investment against with the benchmark — alpha.

As for alpha-generating opportunities, Goldman suggests sniffing around consumer discretionary and information technology.

Goldman scored the companies it thinks will generate alpha based on proportion of returns driven by micro and company specific factors, and how much volatility they might see from returns linked to those factors.

Below is their screen of S&P 500 stocks with the highest scores. However, a cautionary note as the median stock in that list carries a valuation premium to the S&P 500 — 31 times forward price/earnings versus 18 times for the median S&P 500 stock.

Enphase Energy ENPH, , Moderna MRNA, , Align Technology ALGN, , First Solar FSLR, and Bath & Body Works BBWI, ranked highest on the list for dispersion scores. Tesla TSLA, is number 7 on that list.

Goldman also expects further value outperformance in 2023, noting a wide valuation dispersion on that group of stocks — the top quintile from each S&P 500 sector trades at a 160% premium to the cheap bottom. That premium is down from 287% peak in July, but is still extremely elevated, the strategists say.

“Value stocks should outperform as real economic growth reaccelerates and interest rates rise, as our economists expect in their baseline forecasts,” said Kostin and the team.

Stock futures ES00, YM00, are trading mostly flat, though tech NQ00, seems ready for a small lift, with Treasury yields TMUBMUSD10Y, TMUBMUSD02Y, and the dollar DXY, steady and oil prices CL.1, slipping.

"Need to Know: These researchers have studied 123 years of market data and say this is what to expect from stocks and bonds over the next two decades
2023-02-23T12:04:00Z
Well, the worst day of the year for the stock market was followed by, basically nothing. Neither day had much in the way of new fundamental information, and on Thursday stock futures are higher. Animal spirits are as important as hard logic sometimes.

Thursday also saw the release of the Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns yearbook, produced by financial historians Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton. It has the record of returns from equities, bonds, cash and currencies for 35 countries, stretching back to 1900. There is also data covering a total of 90 countries, including the most recent addition, Bosnia and Herzegovina, with data going back to 2011.

First, to the numbers: Over the last 123 years, global equities have returned an annualized return, adjusted for inflation, of 5%; that’s better than the 1.7% real return for bonds, and the 0.4% return for Treasury bills. The best country for inflation-adjusted annualized stock-market returns in U.S. dollar terms since 1900 has been Australia, with a return of 6.43%, though the U.S. is just behind at 6.38%. Equities have outperformed bonds, bills and inflation in all 35 countries where the researchers have data for 123 years.

On the day’s subject du jour, they said that once inflation goes above 8%, it takes multiple years to return to target, citing recent research. Equities do not provide a hedge against inflation, as they found and as 2022 returns showed. And historically, the returns on stocks and bonds have been much lower during hiking cycles than easing cycles.

The researchers also studied commodities: commodities have had a low correlation with equities and a negative correlation with bonds, and provided a hedge against inflation, but they note the investable market size is quite small, making large allocation increases difficult.

Onto the future — they estimate the equity risk premium to bills will be around 3.5%, which is lower than the historical figure of 4.6%. But that still means equity investors should double their money relative to short-term government bills in 20 years. They note that in thinking about future returns, real returns tend to be better in times of higher interest rates than lower rates, citing data over an impressive 2,487 country-years .

They project that for Generation Z will see roughly the same return in stocks as millennials have, but much worse bond returns. Baby boomers, Marsh told a journalist on a call, “just got lucky. I don’t think we will ever return to that.”

U.S. stock futures ES00, NQ00, were pointing to a stronger start. The yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, edged up to 3.96%.

"As Texas Instruments predicted, auto-chip sales are the only bright spot, and shares are calm
2023-01-24T21:37:00Z
A previous version of this report incorrectly stated FactSet estimates for fourth-quarter earnings.



Texas Instruments Inc. shares were relatively placid in the extended session Tuesday following a low-ball beat and a tame outlook. The real attraction, however, was a first look into inventory management amid low demand for consumer electronics, and how sales broke down across categories.

As Texas Instruments’ TXN, quarter came in as expected, weak in all markets except auto chips, the natural concern — when the industry is experiencing supply-chain logjams — was how the analog-chip maker handled its own inventory while focusing on building out long-term capacity. Chip makers like Nvidia Corp. NVDA, spent billions in 2022 to reduce inventory ahead of a major architecture launch.

Concerning inventory, which over the past two years with COVID has gone through a famine that flipped to an irregular feast where few show up, Texas Instruments Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi told analysts on a conference call that his inventory “scorecard” is based on having a broad, diverse customer base and lowering the risk of obsolescence, so the company’s high inventory level serves both short-term and long-term customers .

“So, that’s why we’re comfortable holding higher levels of inventory,” Lizardi told analysts. “I’ve been talking about from current levels, we could add a billion to 2 billion of additional inventory, and the timing, that all depends on revenue trends.”

“On the mix there’s a number of angles on that, chip stock versus finished goods,” Lizardi said. “We have a mix of both of those, in some cases it makes sense to have more of one than the other. But they’re both very low risk. So that’s how we think about it.”

At the top of the call, the company said it was not answering questions on things like its capital expenditure budget or depreciation, as it would go into detail on those at the company’s capital management presentation on Feb. 2. The company said that “big picture,” capex will probably ramp “roughly linearly” to about $2.5 billion in 2025.

Unlike companies such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, , Texas Instruments operates its own fabs, as do Intel Corp. INTC, and Micron Technology Inc. MU, .

Texas Instruments said the industrial market was down 10%, while auto chip sales rose by mid-single digits. Personal electronics fell by mid-teen digits along with the broad-based weakness, while both communication equipment sales and enterprise sales fell 20%.

In 2022, industrial sales made up 40% of revenue, auto chips sales made up about 25%, personal electronics accounted for 20%, communications equipment made up 7%, enterprise systems accounted for 6%, while “Other,” or “primarily calculators,” accounted for 2%, according to prepared remarks.

The company has become increasingly dependent on the industrial and automotive markets, sales from which made up 65% of revenue in 2022, a 300-basis-point increase from 2021, while 10 years ago those segments combined only accounted for 42% of revenue.

For the fourth quarter, the company posted net income of $1.96 billion, or $2.13 a share, compared with $2.14 billion, or $2.27 a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue declined to $4.76 billion from $4.83 billion in the year-ago quarter, the company said.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated earnings of $1.98 a share on revenue of $4.61 billion.

Last quarter, it appeared as if auto-chip sales had become the sole growth driver in the analog chip segment, after the company focused on its long-term capacity buildout, amid a weak outlook for fourth-quarter earnings.

Shares of Texas Instruments TXN, were down 1% in after-hours trading, following a 0.7% decline in the regular session to close at $177.04, and a 0.7% decline in the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, on Tuesday and a virtually flat S&P 500 index SPX, .

"Wolfspeed whiffs on sales and forecast, and its stock is falling
2023-01-25T21:53:00Z
Shares of Wolfspeed Inc. fell about 6% in after-hours action Wednesday after the semiconductor company fell short with its revenue and forecast for the current quarter.

The chip company, which focuses on silicon carbide, generated a fiscal second-quarter net loss of $90.9 million, or 73 cents a share, whereas it lost $96.7 million, or 82 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. After adjusting for stock-based compensation, Wolfspeed WOLF, lost 11 cents a share, compared with an adjusted loss of 16 cents a share in the year-before period. The FactSet consensus called for a 13-cent adjusted loss per share.

Wolfspeed’s revenue climbed to $216.1 million from $173.1 million but came in below the FactSet consensus, which called for $225.3 million. Management at Wolfspeed, formerly known as Cree, expects $210 million to $230 million in revenue for its fiscal third quarter, whereas analysts were modeling $248.4 million. Executives are also expecting an adjusted loss per share of 12 cents to 16 cents, while analysts were expecting a 7-cent adjusted loss per share. “We are capitalizing on the immense opportunity in next-generation power devices by expanding our capacity footprint,” Chief Executive Gregg Lowe said in a release. He noted that the company is “continuing to make progress” on the “ramp” of its Mohawk Valley device fab. “Related to Mohawk Valley, a first-of-its-kind fab, we anticipate recognizing revenue from the facility in the second half of fiscal 2023 and we are in the final stages of scaling production,” he said. “We remain on a trajectory to meet this target, but that will largely depend on both our ability to complete qualifications and ramp up the supply of 200mm wafers, which we believe we will achieve.” Shares of ON Semiconductor Corp. ON, , a chip maker breaking into the market for silicon carbide, were down 3% in aftermarket action Wednesday. Silicon carbide is useful for 5G and electric-vehicle applications.

": Chip sales hit a record in 2022, even as a pandemic shortage turned into a glut
2023-02-03T22:45:00Z
Global semiconductor sales managed to rise slightly to a record high in 2022 even as a two-year pandemic-driven chip shortage flipped to a glut about midyear, slowing down sales dramatically.

Sales of chips worldwide rose 3.2% to a record $573.5 billion in 2022, from 2021’s total of $555.9 billion, when they topped a half a trillion dollars for the first time, according to Semiconductor Industry Association on Friday. Chip sales were strong until about mid-2022, when previously optimistic forecasts soured after it became apparent that inventory was beginning to pile up in the channels."
"AMD stock rises on better-than-feared quarter
2023-01-31T21:27:00Z
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shares rose in the extended session Tuesday after the chip maker’s data-center sales gained and executives forecast sales of more than $5 billion to start 2023, even as cloud-customer demand begins the year light.

AMD shares AMD, rose 3% after hours, following a 3.7% gain in the regular session to close at $75.15.

AMD forecast revenue of $5 billion to $5.6 billion for the first quarter, with declines in client and gaming offset by gains in data-center and embedded sales, and a gross margin of 50%. While that did not blow away Wall Street’s expectations — analysts had estimated earnings of 68 cents a share on revenue of $5.5 billion for the first quarter, according to FactSet — it did quell some fears that cropped up after Intel Corp.’s INTC, disappointing results and forecast last week.

On the call with analysts, AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su called 2022 a “strong” year for the company, a stark contrast to the worst year for rival Intel since the dot-com bust. While PC inventory costs gutted Intel’s results, Su said AMD’s remaining inventory mostly lies in its data-center business, and that the second half of 2023 should be stronger for the segment than the first half.

While she was confident AMD would keep gaining market share from Intel, Su told analysts “there is some inventory at some of the cloud customers, and so we are expecting a softer first half and then a stronger second half.”

“But we feel very good about our market share position and opportunity to grow,” Su said on the earnings call.

Participating in her first conference call as AMD’s chief financial officer, Jean Hu said data-center revenue is expected to decline due to that cloud-customer inventory, and that gross margins are expected to expand in the second half of 2023, after the last of the company’s PC inventory has worked its way through the system. Hu joined AMD from Marvell Technology Inc. MRVL, on Jan. 23 to succeed the retiring Devinder Kumar.

“Going into second half, the normalization of client segment will help us to expand the gross margin,” Hu told analysts. “I think it really depends on how the client segment will recover,” adding that she felt “pretty good” that margins will expand once the client businesses is normalized.

Su said three months ago that AMD would “certainly exit the year in a better place,” after the company’s outlook, which had been below Wall Street estimates at the time, included the cost of clearing out inventory. There were doubts AMD would live up to her words following Intel’s dreary report.

Intel’s worse-than-feared quarterly report arrived as the PC industry deals with the worst shipment declines in recorded history. AMD, Intel and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, had all poured new models of gaming cards into the holiday channel at a time when PC shipments were dropping at their steepest recorded rates and a wave of secondhand graphics-processing units, or GPUs, hit the market as unprofitable cryptocurrency-mining operations folded.

Opinion: Intel just had its worst year since the dot-com bust, and it won’t get better soon

AMD reported fourth-quarter net income of $21 million, or a penny a share, compared with $972 million, or 80 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings, which exclude stock-based compensation expenses and other items, were 69 cents a share, compared with 92 cents a share in the year-ago period.

Revenue rose to $5.6 billion from $4.83 billion in the year-ago quarter, with more than half of that coming from data-center and embedded sales. For the fourth quarter, AMD had forecast revenue of $5.2 billion to $5.8 billion, with its embedded and data-center segments “expected to grow,” with revenue of $23.2 billion to $23.8 billion for the year and gross margins of about 51%.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast 67 cents a share on revenue of $5.52 billion, with expected 2022 revenue of $23.52 billion.

Data-center sales rose 42% to $1.7 billion, while analysts expected $1.71 billion, the company reported, using its reclassified product groups.

"Nvidia forecasts first-quarter revenue above expectations
2023-02-22T21:58:50Z
Feb 22 (Reuters) - Chip designer Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) forecast first-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday as its CEO said use of its chips to power artificial intelligence (AI) services like chatbots had ""gone through the roof in the last 60 days.""

The sales outlook drove Nvidia's shares up 8% in extended trading. The world's largest supplier of chips used in data centers for training AI has become a key hardware supplier for large tech companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) that are building services like chat-powered search engines.

AI is one of the few areas where tech companies are still spending even as the sector slashes jobs. Microsoft and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), for example, are both laying off thousands of employees but are also locked in a race to imbue their search engines with chatbot technology - despite the fact that doing so is likely to add billions of dollars to their operating costs.

Analysts believe that Nvidia, more than any other company, is best positioned to benefit from such increased costs as it dominates roughly 80% of the market for graphics processing units, or GPUs, used to speed up AI work.

On a conference call with investors, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang announced a new service in which Nvidia will directly offer its cloud computing service for companies to rent all of its technologies to develop their own ""generative"" AI services that can create text, images and other forms of data.

AI is still ""not deployed in enterprises broadly, but we believe that by hosting everything in the cloud, from the infrastructure through the operating system software, all the way through pre-trained models, we can accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprises,"" Huang said.

The company forecast current-quarter revenue of $6.50 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts on average expect $6.33 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv data.

Revenue in the quarter ended Jan. 29 was $6.05 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $6.01 billion.

""The launch of generative AI models and the AI arms race taking place should drive accelerated adoption of the company's new H100 products,"" said Logan Purk, an analyst with Edward Jones.

Nvidia's outlook also helped boost the share prices of competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), whose stocks were up 3% after Nvidia's results.

The Santa Clara, California, company got its start in the graphics chip business for PCs by helping video games look more realistic. While its revenue beat Wall Street expectations, Nvidia's sales were still down overall year-on-year as the company weathers a downturn in the PC market.

But growth has remained brisk in the market for data center chips. Analysts at Bank of America Global research believe the boom in so-called generative AI like chatbot and image creation services could add $14 billion more to Nvidia's revenue by 2027.

Nvidia's revenue from the data center business was $3.62 billion for the fourth quarter, slightly below analyst estimates of $3.84 billion. Gaming chip sales were $1.83 billion, beating analyst estimates of $1.52 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Adjusted profit was 88 cents per share for the fourth quarter, beating analyst estimates of 81 cents.

"Nvidia results show its growing lead in AI chip race
2023-02-23T13:00:38Z
Feb 23 (Reuters) - As the artificial intelligence boom takes off, Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) is expected to emerge as the biggest - though not the only - winner among chipmakers after years of focusing on the technology has made it a go-to supplier for tech firms.

AI has emerged as a bright spot for investments in the tech industry, whose slowing growth has led to widespread layoffs and a cutback on experimental bets.

The surge in interest helped Nvidia report better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday and it forecast sales above beat Wall Street expectations, in stark contrast to a projected loss and dividend cut from rival Intel Corp (INTC.O).

Nvidia shares rose nearly 14% to $236.70 on Thursday. They have jumped more than 60% since the turn of the year, nearly three times the gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (.SOX).

The company got its start in the graphics chip business for PCs by helping video games look more realistic, and then rode the cryptocurrency wave as its chips were used for mining. Now, the next push comes from generative AI.

Nvidia's surge Thursday has boosted its market value by more than $70 billion. That brings it to more than $580 billion, about five times that of Intel. It is the seventh-largest publicly traded U.S. firm.

The key to the company's success is that it controls about 80% of the market for graphic processing units (GPUs), which are specialized chips that provide the kind of computing power required for services such as Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI's wildly popular ChatGPT chatbot.

Graphics processing units are designed to handle the specific kind of math involved in AI computing very efficiently, while generic central processing units (CPUs) from Intel can handle a broader range of computing tasks with less efficiency.

AI is taking over the tech industry and, according to research firm Gartner, the share of specialized chips such as GPUs that are used in data centers is expected to rise to more than 15% by 2026 from less than 3% in 2020.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), whose shares also rose after Nvidia earnings on Wednesday, is the second-biggest player in the GPU industry, with a market share of roughly 20%.

""The two companies that are leading the AI revolution on the hardware and processing side are Nvidia and AMD and, in our opinion, these two companies are head and shoulders above everybody else,"" Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar said.

Lisa Su-led AMD has made big investments in AI in recent years, including a series of chips designed to compete with Nvidia's fastest offerings. Intel holds a less than 1% share of the space.

""The enthusiasm around ChatGPT and the potential use case it unlocks likely represents an inflection point in adoption of AI,"" said Lei Qiu, a technology fund portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, which has a 0.54% stake in Nvidia.

""While it is hard to pinpoint exactly how big AI is today as a percent of (Nvidia's) revenue, it has the potential to grow exponentially as large tech companies race to develop similar types of AI applications,"" Qiu said.

Nvidia's strength in the AI industry has also attracted the attention of venture capitalists and startups, which are investing billions of dollars and promising improvements such as lower electricity consumption.

None of them have so far made a big dent in Nvidia's business.

All of this is bad news for Intel, which is also shedding CPU market share to AMD in the data center and personal computer industries that it once dominated. The company now risks losing out on the next growth leg of the industry.

It has in recent months made efforts to sharpen focus on GPUs including a move in December to split its graphic chips unit into two: one focused on personal computers and the other working on data center and AI.

Still, analysts say the company has a long way to go before Intel can make a dent in the market.

""Intel has more designs it has built to try and penetrate the (AI) market ... but to date it's seen a disappointing amount of traction despite its plethora of solutions,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Matthew Bryson said.

"The Ratings Game: See you next Thursday: Texas Instruments analysts await capital-spending details as chip maker builds out during downturn.
2023-01-25T20:47:00Z
Semiconductor analysts by and large are going to have to wait another week for more details on Texas Instruments Inc.’s decision to stay the course with a long-term capacity buildout as the chip sector continues to search for a true bottom.

Late Tuesday, execs played it cool, assuring investors that Texas Instruments TXN, would reveal the rest of its hand Feb. 2 when it comes to its strategy of building out its long-term fab capacity. Meanwhile, even this company — arguably one of the safest bets on the PHLX Semiconductor Index over the past 12 months with its large portfolio of analog chips that proved an essential manufacturing commodity over the course of the pandemic — feels the pinch of falling demand.

That feeling of wait and see extended to Wall Street, as analysts opined about the strategy that’s known so far.

Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter, who has a market-perform rating, calculated that with the added $350 million from the U.S. CHIPS Act, Texas Instruments now has about $400 million in tax credits, so he’ll be expecting “more clarity” on the funding and mechanics of how it will be used.

Buchalter also said Texas Instruments’ willingness to build inventory when most chip makers are trying to deplete theirs “serves as a buffer to end market weakness,” but he added that digestion of that inventory is “unlikely to be contained to a quarter” and that gross margins and free cash flow are already beginning to feel the squeeze.

“We believe investors need visibility into when revenue can re-accelerate,” Buchalter said, along with visibility into “the mechanics and magnitude of

CHIPS Act benefits to feel comfortable with the near-medium [free cash flow] profile, and thus relative potential upside to the stock.”

Read: Intel earnings will be more about the future than the past

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the capex meeting will likely be “eventful,” as it is becoming “increasingly plausible” that Texas Instruments will use a “good portion” of the savings from the credits to boost capital spending even higher, leaving the prospect of gross margins of 60% “likely a few years out.”

“Note that we aren’t necessarily knocking their strategy, as Texas Instruments will be one of the few companies actively building out at some of the deep trailing nodes which may remain tight as we go forward, and in the future (5 years? 10 years?), doubling down now could easily leave them in an advantaged position,” Rasgon said.

That said, Rasgon feels it’s difficult to argue for more upside on the stock at this point and held on to his $145 price target and market-perform rating.

Read: The PC industry just suffered its worst decline on record, again

Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse, who has an in-line rating and a price target of $190, said that with a March-quarter outlook below expectations, worse-than-expected gross margins and the lack of a tangible bottom to the market, he puts a floor of $160 to $165 on the stock, with “weakness mostly priced in.”

“The correction is clearly here, with the key question being the magnitude and duration — with management indicating [three to four quarters of year-over-year] declines as likely,” Muse said.

Of the 32 analysts surveyed by FactSet who cover the stock, 10 have buy ratings, 19 have hold ratings and three have sell ratings, along with an average price target of $183.73, up from $178.87 from two weeks ago.

Over the past 12 months, shares of Texas Instruments TXN, have advanced less than 1%, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, has declined 13%, the S&P 500 SPX, has declined 8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq COMP, is off 16%.

Unlike chip makers such as Nvidia Corp. NVDA, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, , Texas Instruments operates its own fabs, as do Intel Corp. INTC, and Micron Technology Inc. MU, .

In 2022, industrial sales made up 40% of Texas Instruments’ revenue, while automobile-chip sales made up about 25%, personal electronics 20%, communications equipment 7%, and enterprise systems 6%. An “Other” category made up of “primarily calculators” accounted for 2%, according to the company. Of all those categories, only auto-chip sales saw growth

"Earnings Outlook: AMD earnings face even more scrutiny after ‘astonishingly bad’ Intel outlook
2023-01-27T23:00:00Z
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gets to show Wall Street if it “certainly” ended 2022 in a better place, after the price of clearing inventory helped gut results from rival Intel Corp.

AMD AMD, is scheduled to report earnings after the close of markets on Tuesday.

AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su said three months ago that the company’s outlook, which fell below Wall Street estimates at the time, included the cost of clearing out inventory, and that the company would “certainly exit the year in a better place.” Su also said that data-center sales were “expected to grow.”

Doubts about data-center demand and the cost of excess inventory have grown though, after Intel INTC, reported earnings that showed inventory clearance was gutting gross margins as the CPU maker faced the worst PC shipment declines in recorded history. Additionally, Intel said it expected the overall data-center market to fall at “an accelerated rate.”

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who downgraded AMD to market perform from outperform recently, said AMD had “no margin for error” in its report, and this was before he saw Intel’s “astonishingly bad” outlook fail to beat already low expectations “with revenues and gross margins collapsing amid a further weakening environment and an absolutely massive inventory flush.”

Rasgon said the PC market has worsened considerably, to the point where his “belief that AMD would prove relatively more immune to channel degradation proved unfortunately incorrect.”

And with jammed channels, another analyst’s forecast from nearly two years ago appears to be coming to fruition: Intel is resorting to a price war, or what Rasgon called “Intel’s semi-destructive behavior as of late as they use both price and capacity as a strategic weapon.”

“In response, we have seen AMD’s new client parts available at heavy discounts at retail less than 2 months after launch (much deeper, and much more rapidly than the prior generation),” Rasgon said.

NVDA, had all poured new models of gaming cards into the holiday channel at a time when PC shipments are dropping at their steepest recorded rates and a wave of secondhand graphics-processing units, or GPUs, hit the market as unprofitable cryptocurrency-mining operations folded.

“AMD stock should be bigger focus and PC fears are high there despite share gain expectations in server,” Mizuho desk analyst Jordan Klein said in emailed comments. “My view is buyside wants AMD to guide maybe flat growth for ’23 vs cons 5% due to PC flush, then start to slowly buy that weak guide.”

This will be the first report for AMD since it announced the hiring of Jean Hu from Marvell Technology Inc. MRVL, as its new chief financial officer. Hu started at AMD on Jan. 23, succeeding the retiring Devinder Kumar."

It’s the middle of February, and the stock market finally seems caught in the winter doldrums. There may be more gray days ahead.

Even the most optimistic investors will admit that January’s blistering pace—which lingered into the first trading days of February—couldn’t continue indefinitely, not after the Nasdaq Composite posted its best start to a year since 2001. In that sense, the fact that the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2%, the S&P 500 index fell 1.1%, and the Nasdaq dropped 2.4% this past week isn’t too troubling."

"Bad news for the ‘pessimistic bulls’. Here’s 10 reasons why a U.S recession won’t happen.
2023-02-17T11:50:00Z
Stocks look like ending the week on the back foot after a recent batch of stronger-than-expected economic data triggered further hawkish Fed chatter.

This is not a great scenario for the “pessimistic bulls,” the name Gavekal Research’s chairman and chief economist Anatole Kaletsky gives to those investors who consider themselves “cautiously pessimistic because they anticipate an early U.S. recession.”

In fact, he adds, they are actually “wildly bullish” because they hope any economic contraction will help to swiftly trim inflation and allow the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates by the summer. This in turn will spark a rebound in both bonds and stocks to the range enjoyed before Russia invaded Ukraine.

Unfortunately for this tribe, a U.S. recession in the next few months is almost inconceivable, reckons Kaletsky, and if anything the economy is likely to pick up speed later in 2023.

Here are the 10 reasons he believes this to be the case. It’s a long list, so presenting some of Kaletsky’s text as bullet points is necessary.
• In the post-war era, a U.S. recession has never begun with real interest rates deeply negative across the yield curve. If we focus on the level of interest rates instead of the rate of change, this monetary tightening is still the mildest in any cycle since the 1950s.
• Real long rates will remain negative even after the Fed funds rate reaches 5%. The U.S. yield curve is so deeply inverted that real long rates will remain negative even if inflation falls below 5% — unless the curve rapidly disinverts. Neither of these events is likely in the months ahead.
• Yield curve inversion is not a useful recession indicator. Inversions preceded all U.S. recessions since 1970, but there were several false or very premature predictions (in 1966, 1978, 2006 and 2019, unless you believe that COVID came from Wall Street, not Wuhan).
• The U.S. labor market is too strong for a recession.
• Aggregate real income has grown even while average real wages have fallen. That’s because “rapid employment growth has more than offset the decline in real wages.”
• Real wage growth will soon turn positive. With the labor market still extremely tight, wage gains should continue above 5% for the next few months while price inflation should ease to below 5%, unless there is another oil shock.
• The stock of personal savings is still far above normal, thanks to government COVID handouts and cutbacks in consumption during lockdown. The order of magnitude is generally agreed to be $1-2 trillion, equivalent to between 5% and 12% of U.S. household consumption.
• Housing is now stabilizing. Today’s 30-year mortgage rate is lower than at any time in U.S. history before the 2004-07 housing bubble.
• Activity is shifting from goods to services. Big losses in manufacturing are compensated by smaller gains in the much larger service sectors. The net result is that the economy continues to grow.
• A U.S. recession in 2023 is “too good to be true.” If a mild U.S. recession happens this year, as most investors now expect, it will prove that Goldilocks, the Magic Money Tree and “immaculate disinflation” are serious economics, not just myths and fairy tales. If so, we will all have to reconsider what we thought we knew about fiscal prudence, sound monetary management and difficult political trade-offs.

So, in summary: no recession, Kaletsky thinks. “This means that the real question about monetary policy in the U.S. this year is not when the Fed will start easing. It is whether the Fed will decide in the summer to tighten substantially further, or to accept permanently higher inflation—in either case precipitating a second plunge in bond and equity prices,” says Kaletsky.

Stocks were in line to extend Thursday’s losses with S&P 500 futures ES00, down 0.7%. Ten-year Treasury yields TMUBMUSD10Y, rose 3.8 basis points to 3.900% as investors continued to fear inflation will remain stubbornly high. The dollar index DXY, added 0.6% and gold GC00, fell 1.1%.

"AMD results may have given Wall Street sigh of relief, but they’re still a ‘mixed bag’ because of data-center weakness
2023-02-01T06:16:00Z
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. may have unleashed a collective sigh of relief on Wall Street with its results, but the data-center weakness that helped trash Intel Corp.’s earnings last week is still showing up as a dip in the first half of AMD’s 2023.

Late Tuesday, AMD AMD, reported modest results compared with Wall Street expectations, and while those expectations had been managed a quarter ago with an inventory clearance of PC stock, the company must also account for inventory in its data-center business.

PC inventory clearance promises to wrench about 400 basis points of gross margin from Intel INTC, , as the industry deals with the worst shipment declines in recorded history. But it appears as if AMD is not out of the woods yet, as now the inventory focus turns to data-center products that are expected to see light demand in the first half of 2023 from “some of the cloud customers,” according to AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su on the post-report call with analysts.

Read: AMD CEO promises to keep taking data-center from Intel even as cloud demand pauses following ‘strong’ 2022

Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh, who has buy rating and a $90 price target, said AMD’s data-center outlook is similar to the one he expects for the segment as Oracle Corp. ORCL, and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, drive cloud demand in the second half of 2023.

While Intel closed out its worst year since the dot-com bust, AMD’s Su characterized 2022 as a “strong” year for the company. Su said AMD’s remaining inventory mostly lies in its data-center business, so the second half of 2023 there should be stronger than the first half.

Not only did AMD, Intel and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, all pour new models of gaming cards into a holiday channel where PC shipments were dropping at their steepest recorded rates and a wave of secondhand gaming cards flooded the markets as unprofitable cryptocurrency-mining operations folded, inventory proved to be an issue in other segments.

Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay, who has an outperform rating, and a $100 price target, called the report a “mixed bag…but in stark contrast to Intel last week.”

While the data-center outlook for the first quarter was below consensus and lower than expected gross margins expected, AMD’s confidence in the second-half recovery and share gains rank as positives, Ramsay said.

“A weak current macro, no doubt; but 2023 share gains should pay larger dividends as the macro improves in 2H23 into 2024,” Ramsay said.

Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who recently downgraded AMD to market-perform and has an $80 price target, called the results “decent,” and said weakness remains because of inventory both in data-center and client.

“While on an absolute basis results were not great, relative to their larger competitor’s report last week the print came across much better, and while the company is being impacted by macro and inventory issues across their business Intel appears to be affected in a much worse way,” Rasgon said.

Summit Insights analyst Kinngai Chan, who has a hold rating on AMD, said the company’s first-quarter outlook of weaker cloud demand was consistent with his view, and that he expects “AMD share gains in the data center market will be less meaningful in 2023 compared to 2022.”

Of the 43 analysts who cover AMD, 33 have buy ratings, and 10 have hold ratings, along with a price target of $88.48.

AMD shares surged Wednesday to finish the session up 12.6% at $84.64, following a final-hour boost in the broader market after the Federal Reserve raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points.

AMD shares were crushed with a 55% price decline in 2022, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, dropped 35.8%, the S&P 500 index SPX, finished the year down 19.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, shed 33.1%. Over January, however, markets rallied, and AMD shares surged 15%, while the SOX index gained 15%, the S&P 500 gained 6%, and the Nasdaq rose 10%."
"AMD earnings: What to expect
2023-01-31T12:51:00Z
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. faces a sobered Wall Street when the chip maker reports its earnings Tuesday, after analysts reacted to Intel Corp.’s quarterly report by scaling back expectations.

AMD AMD, , however, still has very little room for error given it predicted it would exit the year in a good place, after turning in a weak outlook last quarter that factored in inventory costs. Analysts are expecting AMD to issue a weak 2023 forecast after Intel INTC, reported earnings that showed how much inventory clearance was gutting gross margins as the CPU maker faced the worst PC shipment declines in recorded history. Intel also warned of a contracting data-center market.

In-depth: AMD earnings face even more scrutiny after ‘astonishingly bad’ Intel outlook

Here’s what Wall Street expects to see from AMD on Tuesday.

Earnings: AMD on average is expected to post adjusted earnings of 67 cents a share, down from the $1.13 a share expected at the beginning of the quarter, and down from the 92 cents a share reported in the year-ago period, according to a FactSet survey of 34 analysts. Estimize, a software platform that crowdsources estimates from hedge-fund executives, brokerages, buy-side analysts and others, calls for earnings of 69 cents a share.

Revenue: AMD, on average, is expected to post revenue of $5.51 billion, according to 31 analysts polled FactSet, down from the Street’s forecast of $7.08 billion at the start of the quarter, but up 14% from a year ago. Estimize expects revenue of $5.55 billion.

While the larger sales number from analysts has remained the same, analysts have been fine-tuning their segment estimates in recent days, according to FactSet data. This is how Wall Street expects AMD’s sales to break down following Intel earnings: Data center sales of $1.71 billion down from $1.72 billion last week; client sales of $988.7 million from $1.02 billion a week ago; gaming sales of $1.52 billion from $1.53 billion, while embedded sales estimates have crept up to $1.34 billion from $1.33 billion last week. Apples-to-apples comparisons from a year ago are difficult given that AMD instituted a new business segment reporting structure that finally split data-center-sales from gaming chip sales.

Stock movement: In nine of the past 10 quarters, AMD earnings and sales have both topped Wall Street estimates, but share movement the next day isn’t as predictable, with shares closing down in six of those quarters.

AMD shares were crushed with a 55% price decline in 2022, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, dropped 35.8%, the S&P 500 index SPX, finished the year down 19.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, shed 33.1%.

Over the fourth quarter, those drops reflected a bounce off October lows on the year. AMD shares advanced 2.2% for the quarter, the SOX index rose 9.8%, the S&P 500 gained 7.1%, and Nasdaq slipped 1%.

What analysts are saying

Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, who has an overweight rating and calls AMD his “top pick,” said he expects near-term weakness in data center to weigh on AMD’s first-quarter outlook, and he lowered his expectations for the year.

“Our initial assumption that the company can guide the full year to roughly consensus numbers might be at risk given Intel issues and new CFO,” Moore said. “But the opportunity remains significant.”

Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay, who rates AMD an outperform stock, expects a “strong but beatable 2023 outlook,” but he also suggested that figuring out the right numbers is both an art and science.

Ramsay said macro risks for the March-ending quarter are well known, and that while AMD’s negative pre-announcement back in October and soft fourth-quarter guidance “came as a disappointment,” they served to de-risk the stock.

"S.Korea aims to join AI race as startup Rebellions launches new chip

SEOUL Feb 13 (Reuters) - South Korean startup Rebellions Inc launches an artificial intelligence (AI) chip on Monday, racing to win government contracts as Seoul seeks a place for local companies in the exploding AI industry.

The company's ATOM chip is the latest Korean attempt to challenge global leader Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) in the hardware that powers the potentially revolutionary AI technology.

AI is the talk of the tech world, as ChatGPT - a chatbot from Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI that generates articles, essays, jokes and even poetry - has become the fastest-growing consumer app in history just two months after launch, according to UBS.

Nvidia, a U.S. chip designer, has a commanding share of high-end AI chips, making up about 86% of the computing power of the world’s six biggest cloud services as of December, according to Jefferies chip analyst Mark Lipacis.

The South Korean government wants to foster a domestic industry, investing more than $800 million over the next five years for research and development in a bid to lift the market share of Korean AI chips in domestic data centres from essentially zero to 80% by 2030.

""It’s hard to catch up to Nvidia, which is so far ahead in general-purpose AI chips,"" said Kim Yang-Paeng, senior researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade. ""But it's not set in stone because AI chips can carry out different functions and there aren't set boundaries or metrics.""

Rebellions' ATOM is designed to excel at running computer vision and chatbot AI applications. Because it targets specific tasks rather than doing a wide range, the chip consumes only about 20% of the power of an Nvidia A100 chip on those tasks, said Rebellions co-founder and chief executive Park Sunghyun.

A100 is the most popular chip for AI workloads, powerful enough to create - in industry lingo, ""train"" - the AI models. ATOM, designed by Rebellions and manufactured by Korean giant Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS), does not do training.

While countries such as Taiwan, China, France, Germany and the United States have extensive plans to support their semiconductor companies, the South Korean government is rare in singling out AI chips for a concentrated push.

Seoul will put out a notice this month for two data centres, called neural processing unit farms, with only domestic chipmakers allowed to bid, an official at the Ministry of Science and ICT told Reuters.

In a country whose firms supply half the world's memory chips, the authorities want to create a market that can be a test bed for AI chipmakers, aiming to foster global competitors.

""The government is twisting the arm of the data centres and telling them, 'Hey, use these chips',"" Rebellions' Park, a former Morgan Stanley engineer, told Reuters.

Without such support, he said, data centres and their customers would likely stick with Nvidia chips.

Sapeon Korea Inc also plans to participate in the project, the SK Telecom Co (017670.KS) subsidiary said.

FuriosaAI, backed by South Korea's top search engine Naver Corp (035420.KS) and state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB.UL), told Reuters it will also bid.

""There's a lot of momentum behind Nvidia's developments. These startups have got to build momentum, so that will take time,"" said Alan Priestley, an analyst at IT research firm Gartner. ""But government incentives such as what's happening in Korea could well affect the market share within Korea.""

Rebellions will seek to participate in the government project in a consortium with KT Corp (030200.KS), a big Korean telecom, cloud and data centre operator, in the hopes of weaning Nvidia customers off the U.S. supplier.

""Amid high dependence on foreign GPUs (graphics processing units) globally, the cooperation between KT and Rebellions will allow us to have an 'AI full stack' that encompasses software and hardware based on domestic technology,” said KT vice president Bae Han-chul.

"As Earnings Season Ends, Stocks Get Marked Down. The Good News: It Isn’t a Recession.

With only a few big names left to report, 80% of S&P 500 companies have now delivered results, putting the index’s earnings per share on track to contract 2.2% for the fourth quarter—the first quarterly drop since 2020’s third quarter. This isn’t a surprise: Weakening profit margins have been evident in recent quarters, and many companies have warned on profits.

"These 20 stocks led the January rally
2023-01-31T16:58:00Z
The initial version of this story had incorrect price changes for 2023. It is now updated with information as of the market close on Jan. 31.

Investors staged a January rally, with solid gains for the S&P 500 and an even better showing for technology stocks that led the dismal downward action in 2022.

This may be a surprise, in light of the difficulties being reported by many companies this earnings season, along with mounting tech layoffs, but the stock market always looks far ahead. As evidenced by the inverted yield curve in the bond market, investors expect the Federal Reserve to stop its cycle of interest-rate increases and even pivot to begin stimulating the economy later this year.

On Tuesday, two-year U.S. Treasury notes BX:TMUBMUSD02Y were yielding 4.22%, while 10-year Treasury notes BX:TMUBMUSD10Y yielded 3.52%. Since bond prices rise when interest rates decline, investors have poured money into longer-term bonds in anticipation of the Fed’s eventual policy change away from its current inflation-fighting stance. The stock market’s direction can be influenced by the same sentiment.

The Federal Open Market Committee meets today and Wednesday, after which Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference to discuss monetary policy. Here’s what to expect.

The S&P 500 SPX was up 6.2% for 2023 through Jan. 31, following a 19.4% decline in 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 2.8% for the month, while the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite Index COMP showed a 10.7% gain for January. (All price changes in this article exclude dividends.)

Here’s a rundown of how the 11 sectors of the S&P 500 performed during January, with the full S&P 500 and the other two indexes at the bottom:

The top two sectors so far this year are last year’s two weakest performers — Consumer Discretionary and Communications Services. In case this is a surprise, keep in mind that a tech stock might not be in the information technology sector, as defined by S&P Dow Jones Indices.

The S&P 500 and its sectors are weighted by market capitalization. The largest stocks in the consumer discretionary sector are Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Tesla Inc. TSLA, while the stocks in the communications sector with the heaviest weighting are Google holding company Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Meta Platforms Inc. META, which is Facebook’s parent company.

The right-most columns in the sector table show changes in forward price-to-earnings ratios. These have declined since the end of 2021 for all S&P 500 sectors except Materials and Health Care. This is especially noteworthy for the energy sector following a strong performance in 2022. Energy remains the cheapest sector on a forward P/E basis.

Here’s how the forward P/E valuation for the S&P 500 has moved over the past 10 years.

The current valuation is far lower than it was at the end of 2021, but it is higher than the 10-year average valuation of 17.4 and the 20-year average of 15.7.

"Distributed Ledger: Why stocks may have more room to fall than crypto this year, according to one analyst
2023-02-23T20:39:00Z
Hello! Welcome back to Distributed Ledger. This is Frances Yue, crypto reporter at MarketWatch.

Bitcoin has been trading in a range between $23,500 and $25,000 for the past week, as U.S. regulators heighten their oversight of the industry, while Hong Kong is setting up a task force to achieve its goal of becoming a crypto hub.

I caught up with Martin Leinweber, digital assets product strategist at MarketVector Indexes, who said he expects more downside in the U.S. equity market than in crypto this year amid macroeconomic uncertainty.

As usual, find me on Twitter at @FrancesYue_ to share any thoughts on crypto, this newsletter or your personal stories with digital assets.

“I think the crypto market has digested a lot more negative headlines than the equity market,” MarketVector’s Leinweber said.

As the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates, bitcoin lost more than 65% in 2022, and ether declined almost 70%, according to CoinDesk data. Some smaller tokens lost 90% of their value or more. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, dropped roughly 9% in 2022, the S&P 500 SPX, closed the year 19% lower, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, went down about 33%, according to FactSet data.

So far this year, bitcoin rallied more than 45%, while the Dow was roughly flat and the S&P 500 remained up around 4.6%. The Nasdaq has gained around 10%.

“From looking what is happening now in the crypto space — like all the transactions, price behavior, the sector’s stickiness and even the relative strength against equities, I think they show a bullish sign,” Leinweber told Distributed Ledger in a call.

Earlier this week, Hong Kong outlined a plan to let individual investors trade cryptocurrencies with larger market capitalizations. The city will also set up a task force to provide recommendations on development of the digital asset industry, according to several media reports.

Tokens with strong China links soared during the past week, logging double or even triple-digit gains. Cryptocurrency Conflux surged 204% during the past seven days. Filecoin advanced 43% and Neo gained over 40% during the same period.

Meanwhile, during the crypto rally last week, most trading activity happened in the Asian and European trading hours, noted James Lavish, managing partner and portfolio manager at the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund. “It was clearly not U.S. activity,” according to Lavish.

Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, which would allow validators of the blockchain to withdraw their staked ether, is scheduled for March. Staking allows crypto holders to obtain rewards while using their existing holdings to secure the underlying blockchain.

Some are worried that the Shanghai upgrade would bring short-term volatility to ether as investors might withdraw their staked coins. However, Leinweber said he thinks the upgrade is bullish for the crypto in the long term, as increased liquidity may attract more people to stake their ether.

To be sure, regulatory uncertainties around staking remain in the U.S.. Earlier this month, crypto exchange Kraken ended its staking program in the country, after the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the company with failing to register the program as security.

The crypto derivatives markets have also sent some bullish signals, according to Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata.

The six-month bitcoin options have been pricing in more upside volatility than downside volatility, meaning that traders are expecting more upside surprises for the next few months, noted Magadini. The trend is vastly different from the bitcoin options dynamic in 2022, Magadini said in a call.

Bitcoin lost 1.1% in the past week and was trading at around $23,919 on Thursday, according to CoinDesk data. Ether dipped 2% in the same period to around $1,660.

Shares of Coinbase Global Inc. COIN, lost 5.4% for the week to around $62.22. MicroStrategy Inc. MSTR, declined 5.5% thus far on the week, to $268.35.

Crypto mining company Riot Blockchain Inc. RIOT, edged up 0.6%, to $6.40 as of Thursday. Shares of rival Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. MARA, were up 1% to $7.30 over the past week. Ebang International Holdings Inc. EBON, plunged 10.6% over the past week and was trading at $7.59.

"Factbox: Chinese chipmakers caught in U.S.-China tech spat | Reuters
2023-01-31T07:05:19Z
SHANGHAI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - China's semiconductor industry has become a key target of the United States, which has imposed a slew of export restrictions targeting several parts of the country's chip sector supply chain as it bids to slow its rival's technological advancement.

While Beijing has ploughed vast sums of money into cultivating a domestic chip industry, its fabrication plants, known as fabs, still heavily rely on foreign-made equipment that they use to turn slabs of silicon into chips that power hardware.

Below are the Chinese fabs that are bearing the biggest brunt of Washington's curbs:

SMIC (0981.HK), China's largest fab, makes chips that go into a range of products for the automotive sector, internet-of-things devices and some smartphones.

Founded in 2000 with backing from the Shanghai government, the firm stands as China's would-be rival to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW), though it is dwarfed in technology and income. TSMC is the world's most valuable chipmaker and counts Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) among major clients.

Its government-backing and ambition to make high-end chips caught the attention of the United States which put the firm on its Entity List in 2020. The placement effectively barred Dutch firm ASML Holding AS (ASML.AS) from providing critical Extreme Ultraviolet lithography machines to SMIC, scuttling that ambition.

To date, most of SMIC's sales are made using the outdated 45 nanometer process node and above. Since late 2020, this specialisation in older chips has proven a boon due to a global shortage of lower-end chips.

Still, its global market share in the pure-play foundry sector remains in the single digits, and its sales and research-and-development expenditure remain well below those of TSMC.

The company shocked the industry in 2022 when researchers discovered it had produced a chip that appeared to share qualities with TSMC's 7 nanometer process node technology, even without ASML equipment.

Experts disputed the long-term viability of its breakthrough. SMIC has not responded to the findings.

Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd (1347.HK) is China's second-largest fab. It was founded in 1996 and specialises in making mature-node technology, generating most of its revenue from chips made at the 55 nanometer process node and above.

The firm has devoted fewer resources to producing advanced nodes than SMIC. It plans to conduct an additional public offering in 2023, and aims to build a new fab in the eastern city of Wuxi.

YMTC is China's only player in the global NAND memory market - an ultra-competitive sector long dominated by a handful of firms from the United States and Korea. It designs and makes chips and was added to the U.S. Entity List last year.

While YMTC's market share of the overall sector is small, experts said it has steadily entered the Chinese supply chain and that its products have become more competitive on price and quality.

It unveiled a chip last year with 232 layers of memory cells, placing the firm closer to rivals such as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS). Experts said equipment export restrictions are likely to derail further efforts.

YMTC was founded in 2016 with backing from the Wuhan government and China National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, and originally operated under chip conglomerate Tsinghua Unigroup. It was later spun out as its parent company restructured while facing bankruptcy.

CXMT is China's only major player designing and making DRAM chips, which like NAND memory, is a sector long dominated by a handful of legacy companies in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.

It has one fab in operation and is building two others. It produces DRAM at the 19 nanometer node and is moving into the 17 nanometer node - process nodes behind the industry leading-edge.

Researcher Trendforce wrote that the impact from equipment export restrictions imposed since October might affect expansion plans.

"Retail investor risk appetite improves with AI stocks leading
2023-02-14T11:25:53Z

NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Some of Wall Street's most speculative names, including meme stocks and shares of artificial intelligence companies, are leading the equity market rally this year, helped by renewed interest from retail investors.

Retail investors had a poor year in 2022, with the average portfolio ending the year down around 35% from all-time highs, Vanda Research previously estimated.

However, retail investors have shown renewed interest in the early part of 2023. Aggregate inflows into the U.S. stock market, though concentrated in a few names, has reached levels last seen in 2020-21, according to Vanda Research.

Shares of companies linked to artificial intelligence have soared after U.S. firm OpenAI, the owner of ChatGPT, a chatbot that gives strikingly human-like responses to user queries, snagged a multi-billion dollar investment from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).

Meme stocks have clawed back some of last year's losses, while shares of larger, tech-focused companies such as Nvidia and Tesla have also joined in the fray.

The Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC), home of many smaller, more speculative companies as well as the megacaps, is up 13% this year, after a 33% loss in 2022. The S&P 500 index is up about 7%.

""We've definitely seen risk appetites return to equity markets this year,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.

Companies building artificial intelligence tools have been among the rally's biggest winners, a move market observers say has been driven in part by retail investors.

Big gainers include shares in analytics firm BigBear.ai , which are up 500% this year, and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O), up 50%. Meanwhile, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) jostle to pull ahead in the race for the next big growth driver.

Five of the largest Artificial Intelligence ETFs, which offer exposure to firms involved in the development and production of robots or artificial intelligence, have grown assets to $4.27 billion, up 18% this year, compared with a 10% rise in assets for the Nasdaq 100-tracking Invesco QQQ ETF .

Meanwhile, shares of early meme stocks GameStop (GME.N) and AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) have pared some losses after last year's tumble.

Not all meme stocks are thriving, however: shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O), which soared as much as 180% in early February, have retreated to trade down 19% for the year as investors await details on whether the struggling retailer can avoid bankruptcy.

Many market participants are quick to draw contrasts between the current rally in speculative names and meme stocks' initial surge in 2021.

One key comparison is bond yields, which now offer increased competition to stocks after hitting multi-year highs in 2022 as the Fed tightened monetary policy. Investors have recently recalibrated how high the Fed might raise rates this year amid signs of a stronger-than-expected job market.

""The current state of play is undoubtedly more challenging,"" analysts at Vanda Research said in a note on Thursday.

The Fed's rate-hiking campaign has tightened financial conditions relative to two years ago, with the Chicago Fed's U.S. National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) at -0.36, compared to -0.62 in 2021, signaling tighter financial conditions.

The return to risk-taking is showing up in record trading volumes in the U.S. options market.

Demand for calls, which convey the right to buy stock at a fixed price in the future, has outstripped puts, typically used for bearish wagers, with 1.15 calls traded for every put over the last month, per Trade Alert data.

Still, that measure is not as euphoric as in 2021, when it reached a high of two calls traded for every put.

While retail traders may be rushing in, short sellers - who aim to profit by selling borrowed shares and hoping to buy them back later at a lower price - have been adding to their bets, particularly in the AI space.

"Israeli blockchain chip startup Chain Reaction raises $70 mln
2023-02-23T09:05:31Z
OAKLAND, Calif., Feb 23 (Reuters) - Tel Aviv-based blockchain chip startup Chain Reaction on Thursday said it raised $70 million which will be used to expand its engineering team as it develops its next chip and rolls out its first one to the market this year.

Alon Webman, co-founder and CEO of Chain Reaction, told Reuters that the company will start mass producing its blockchain chip Electrum in the first quarter this year. He said the chip is designed to carry out blockchain operations called ""hashing"" very fast and power efficiently and also can be used for mining digital currencies like bitcoin.

Webman said he was confident the company could gain market share in the blockchain chip segment which he expects will support its more ambitious goal of creating a so-called ""fully homomorphic encryption"" chip that allows users to work on data while it's encrypted.

He aims to launch that chip as early as end-2024.

He said many industries such as defence and governments can't completely move to the cloud due to security issues. ""Today if you have data (which) is encrypted into the cloud and in order to do any data operation or data analytics, do A.I., you have to decrypt the data,"" said Webman. ""The moment the data is decrypted, it can be attacked by a malicious user to read it, to steal it, or even to change it.""

Webman said he has been involved in designing over 30 chips. He is the co-founder of Mellanox Technologies Ltd., a datacenter networking chip company that U.S. chip supplier Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) bought for nearly $7 billion in 2020.

The latest funding round was led by Morgan Creek Digital, a venture capital firm specializing in blockchain technology, AI, and digital assets, and brings the total raised to $115 million."
"Associated Press: Asian markets skid after inflation report thumps Wall Street
2023-02-17T04:45:00Z
BANGKOK — Shares slipped in Asia on Friday after benchmarks on Wall Street had their biggest drop in four weeks as investors registered disappointment over an inflation reading that came in hotter than expected.

Oil prices and U.S. futures YM00, ES00, also declined after the S&P 500 fell 1.4% Thursday following news that inflation at the wholesale level slowed by less than economists had forecast. It echoed a report on prices at the consumer level from earlier this week that suggested inflation isn’t cooling as quickly and as smoothly as hoped.

Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 NIK, fell 0.7% while the Hang Seng HSI, in Hong Kong lost 0.6%. The Kospi 180721, in South Korea sank 0.7%

The Shanghai Composite index SHCOMP, gave up 0.2% and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, shed 0.8%. Stocks gained in Singapore STI, , but fell in Taiwan Y9999, , Malaysia FBMKLCI, and Indonesia JAKIDX, .

Bangkok’s SET index SET, fell 0.2% after the government reported the economy grew at a meager 2.6% annual pace in 2022 and slowed more than expected in the last quarter of the year, to a 1.3% annual expansion, as a rebound in tourism failed to make up for weaker exports.

On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, lost 1.3% to 33,696.85, while the Nasdaq composite COMP, dropped 1.8% to 11,855.83.

The S&P 500 SPX, ended at 4,090.41. A 2.7% fall for Microsoft MSFT, , 3.3% drop for Nvidia NVDA, and 4.7% slide for Tesla TSLA, were some of the heaviest weights on the benchmark index.

Stocks have been churning recently on worries that persistently high inflation will push the Federal Reserve to get even more aggressive on interest rates. Higher rates can drive down inflation but also drag on investment prices and raise the risk of a serious recession.

Such fears have been most clear in the bond market, where yields have leaped this month as traders raise their forecasts for how high the Fed will take interest rates.

Treasury yields rose Thursday as traders upped their bets for how high the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to combat inflation. Higher rates hurt the economy and weigh on financial markets. Other data on the economy chipped away at hopes the Fed might wrestle inflation lower without causing a severe recession.

The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.67% from less than 4.60% before the inflation report’s release and from less than 4.10% earlier this month. It’s near its highest level since November, when the yield reached levels last seen in 2007.

Thursday’s inflation report showed that prices at the wholesale level were 6% higher last month than a year earlier, slower than December’s rate but worse than expected. Perhaps more concerning was that inflation accelerated in January on a month-to-month basis even after stripping out prices for food, energy and other layers.

The inflation report thudded onto Wall Street along with a batch of other data painting a mixed picture of the economy.

Fewer workers applied for jobless benefits last week than expected, suggesting that layoffs remain low across the economy. That’s good news for workers and another signal of strength for the job market, but the Fed worries it could also add upward pressure on inflation.

Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said in a speech Thursday that she saw “a compelling economic case” at the Fed’s meeting earlier this month to raise rates by double what it did.

In other trading on Friday, U.S. benchmark crude CLH23 oil lost 64 cents to $77.85 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude BRNJ23, , the international pricing basis, gave up 68 cents to $84.46 per barrel.

The dollar USDJPY, rose to 134.67 Japanese yen from 133.99 yen."
"ETF Wrap: QQQ is bleeding assets, but are ETF investors ‘finally bailing’ on growth stocks just as tech stocks jump in 2023?
2023-01-26T21:12:00Z
Hello! This week’s ETF Wrap shines a light on the relatively strong performance of technology and growth stocks this year as a large fund tracking the Nasdaq-100 index suffers outflows.

Please send feedback and tips to christine.idzelis@marketwatch.com. You can also follow me on Twitter at @cidzelis and find me on LinkedIn.

Sign up here for our weekly ETF Wrap.

Technology and growth stocks are off to a strong start in 2023, but a popular exchange-traded fund isn’t getting much love lately.

The Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, , an ETF tracking the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index, has seen $5.7 billion of outflows this year, according to a Strategas research note dated Jan. 24. And over the last two months, the fund has bled around $12 billion, which Strategas ETF strategist Todd Sohn described in the note as “a record” and questioned whether investors are “finally bailing on growth-oriented areas” of the stock market.

That might not be the case, according to Ryan McCormack, a senior factor and core ETF strategist at Invesco.

“The flow picture doesn’t necessarily tell the story of the long-only investor,” said McCormack, in a phone interview. “For that, we look toward QQQM,” which has seen inflows so far this year, he said.

The Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQM, , which trades under the ticker QQQM, was launched in October 2020. Like QQQ, it provides exposure to the Nasdaq 100, but it’s five basis points cheaper — a 25% expense ratio reduction — and caters to longer-term, “buy-and-hold” investors, said McCormack.

QQQM has an expense ratio of 0.15%, while the much larger, actively-traded QQQ charges 0.20%.

The Invesco QQQ Trust, launched in 1999, is one of the most actively-traded ETFs in the world, according to FactSet. The fund has around $152 billion of assets under management, dwarfing QQQM’s $6 billion on Wednesday, FactSet data show.

The “long-only, retail-driven, buy-and-hold community have largely gravitated toward QQQM,” McCormack said. “We’ve seen pretty consistent inflows there since launch.”

The ETF has attracted about $3.3 billion over the past year, while QQQ saw around $654 million of inflows over the same period, according to McCormack.

Flows for QQQ can be pretty “pretty streaky,” he said, with “tremendous” inflows or outflows in a given day. Institutional investors may use QQQ as just one of their trading tools to gain exposure to the Nasdaq 100, an index heavy in tech and growth stocks, said McCormack. They might also turn to options trading to manage their exposure to the index, he said.

Both QQQ and QQQM were up slightly more than 8% this year through Wednesday, after sinking around 33% last year, FactSet data show. Their performance in 2023 tops the S&P 500 SPX, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, , but that’s also after suffering steeper losses in 2022.

As for flows this year, QQQ has seen $4.9 billion of outflows through Wednesday, while QQQM has seen almost $156 million of inflows, according to FactSet data.

Among their top holdings are Apple Inc. AAPL, , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, , Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp. NVDA, , Google parent Alphabet Inc., Tesla Inc. TSLA, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, , FactSet data show.

Next week, Meta, Apple, Amazon AMZN, and Alphabet GOOGL, will report their quarterly results as earnings season for the fourth quarter continues.

“This round of earnings reports will be quite telling,” McCormack. Amid concerns about a slowing U.S. economy, “investors want to hear what’s going on at the company level.”

Last year was a “supremely challenging environment for growth stocks,” as the Federal Reserve aggressively hiked interest rates to combat high inflation, said McCormack. Investors are trying to be as “forward-looking” as they can, potentially weighing the relative value of the Nasdaq 100 index while “looking to position beyond the economic slowdown.”

The Fed’s next policy meeting is scheduled for Jan. 31 – Feb. 1.

As usual, here’s your look at the top- and bottom-performing ETFs over the past week through Wednesday, according to FactSet data.

"Futures edge lower as earnings roll in, chipmakers retreat
2023-01-24T12:37:28Z
NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended nominally lower on Tuesday at the close of a rocky session marked by a raft of mixed earnings and a technical malfunction at the opening bell.

A spate of NYSE-listed stocks were halted at the top of the session due to an apparent technical malfunction, which caused initial price confusion and prompted an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

More than 80 stocks were affected by the glitch, which caused wide swings in opening prices in dozens of stocks, including Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Nike Inc (NKE.N).

""Everybody’s having computer problems, first the airlines and now it’s the NYSE,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""Seems like it was quickly corrected.""

""Some of the prints were clearly bad,"" Ghriskey added. ""It was a surprise. Unexpected.""

The Nasdaq joined the S&P 500 in negative territory, while the Dow ended modestly higher.

Fourth quarter earnings season is in full swing, with 72 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 65% have beaten consensus, just a hair below the 66% long-term average, according to Refinitiv.

On aggregate, analysts now expect S&P 500 earnings 2.9% below the year-ago quarter, down from the 1.6% year-on-year decline seen on Jan. 1, per Refinitiv.

""The Fed will take apart earnings reports and look at how the economy is doing, given the rate hikes and other issues out there,"" Ghriskey said. ""We’re getting closer to that point where the Fed sees enough progress in the inflation fight to stop the (interest) rate hikes and that’s why the markets have reacted positively lately.""

Economic data showed shallower-than-expected contraction in the manufacturing and services sector in the first weeks of the year, suggesting that the Federal Reserve's restrictive interest rates are dampening demand.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 104.4 points, or 0.31%, to 33,733.96, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 2.86 points, or 0.07%, to 4,016.95 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 30.14 points, or 0.27%, to 11,334.27.

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, industrials suffered the biggest loss.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N), owner of the New York Stock Exchange, dropped 2.2% as SEC investigators searched for the cause of Tuesday's opening bell confusion.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) shares dipped 2.1% after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Google for abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business.

Industrial conglomerates 3M Co (MMM.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N) both provided underwhelming forward guidance due to inflationary headwinds.

Aerospace/defense companies Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX.N) were a study in contrasts, with the former issuing a disappointing profit forecast and the latter beating estimates on solid travel demand.

Lockheed Martin and Raytheon were up 1.8% and 3.3%, respectively.

Railroad operator Union Pacific Corp missed profit estimates as labor shortages and severe weather delayed shipments. Its shares shed 3.3%.

Microsoft (MSFT.O) gained more than 4% in extended trading after narrowly missing quarterly revenue estimates.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 22 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.58 billion shares, compared with the 10.61 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

"Wall Street Week Ahead: Retailers' results may be next test for rally in U.S. stocks
2023-02-19T14:02:42Z
NEW YORK, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Earnings results from major retailers in the coming weeks will test the strength of the U.S. stock market rally, as investors gain insight into the health of consumer spending and the fallout on company bottom lines from inflation.

As a tepid fourth-quarter results season comes to an end, Walmart (WMT.N) and Home Depot (HD.N) are set to report in the coming week, with other high-profile retailers including Best Buy (BBY.N) and Lowe's (LOW.N) due the following week.

How consumers are faring amid soaring prices will be a critical topic for investors, as some have become more confident that the economy will be able to avoid a severe downturn even as the Federal Reserve continues hiking rates to tamp down inflation.

One sign of economic resilience came in the past week, when monthly data showed U.S. retail sales increased by the most in nearly two years in January.

“The retail sales numbers were reasonably strong, and we want to see that confirmation come from the retailers themselves,” said Paul Nolte, market strategist at Murphy and Sylvest Wealth Management.

Nolte is considering buying home-improvement retailer stocks that were hit hard in 2022 as the housing market struggled.

Stocks have run up despite underwhelming fourth-quarter earnings that has S&P 500 firms on track to post a 2.8% drop in profits from the year-ago period, according to Refintiv IBES. Other companies set to report next week include chip company Nvidia (NVDA.O), COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna (MRNA.O) and e-commerce firm eBay (EBAY.O).

The S&P 500 has gained 6.5% so far in 2023 as of Thursday, with stocks bouncing back from a brutal performance last year.

Retail stocks have put up mixed returns so far in 2023. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT.P), which weights small and large companies fairly evenly, has jumped 17% this year. But the performance has been less rosy for some of the biggest companies.

Shares of Walmart, the world's largest retailer by sales, have gained only 1.7% in 2023, while shares of Home Depot, the top U.S. home improvement chain, are also up 1.7%. Both companies are set to report on Tuesday and will ""set the stage for everyone else,"" according to JPMorgan retail analysts.

""We expect HD and WMT’s tone on guidance and the consumer to be cautious at best,"" the JPMorgan analysts wrote in an earnings preview note this week. They rate Walmart shares ""neutral"" and Home Depot as ""overweight.""

Among the other retailers set to report in the coming week are TJX Companies (TJX.N) and Bath & Body Works (BBWI.N).

Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, said he will be watching to see if retailers have been able to push up prices to match their costs.

His firm holds shares of a variety of retailers including discounter Dollar Tree (DLTR.O) and specialty retailers Crocs (CROX.O) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA.O), but does not own broad retailers like Walmart and Amazon (AMZN.O).

""We are clearly emphasizing retailers in select industries versus the mass market retailers,"" Tuz said. ""With the mass retailers, it’s just harder to identify what is going to make them grow.”

Investors next week will also focus on Wednesday's release of minutes from the Fed's latest meeting, when the central bank scaled back its rate hikes to a quarter-point after a year of heftier raises.

Since that meeting, data has shown U.S. consumer prices accelerating and monthly producer prices increasing by the most in seven months in January.

Together with a strong U.S. jobs report, the data has led investors to push up expectations for how high the Fed will raise rates and how long they will stay elevated, with futures now pricing in a peak rate of over 5.2% in July.

Extremely robust retailer earnings could fuel worries about a more hawkish response from the Fed, said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services.

""If those numbers come in and are really, really, really strong, that could be this idea that too much good news is bad news from a Fed perspective,” Carlson said

"SoftBank's Arm China lays off workers as outlook grim -sources
2023-02-11T02:22:27Z
OAKLAND, Calif/SHANGHAI Feb 12 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's (9984.T) chip technology firm Arm Ltd's China joint venture laid off 90-95 employees last week to cope with a challenging business outlook this year, according to two sources familiar with the situation.

The layoffs come as SoftBank tries to set up a public listing for Arm this year. The China market has been a major source of growth, although a two-year management dispute at the joint venture that resulted in the ousting of the former CEO created some challenges.

The sources said those who lost their jobs were mostly engineers in research and development. Before the layoffs, Arm China had about 700 employees; there were no layoffs last year when parent Arm Ltd had global layoffs affecting up to 15% of its workforce, according to one of the sources.

Arm Ltd said in a statement that “Arm China is a separate company from Arm Ltd, and while we cannot comment on its personnel decisions, we do not expect any disruption to our business in China which continues to remain strong.”

Last year's layoffs came after Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) failed to take over Arm because of regulatory hurdles. The collapse of the sale marked a major setback for SoftBank's efforts to generate funds when valuations across its portfolio are under pressure.

Arm China is the exclusive distributor of Arm licenses in China. It collects payments, and sends them to Arm Ltd, which delivers the technology directly to customers.

One of the sources said some customers are concerned about Arm potentially changing how it charges royalties, as well as U.S.-China geopolitical tensions that could cut off access to Arm technology.

Chinese companies, including Huawei Group and Alibaba, have been restricted from using some of Arm's technology in recent years.

"SoftBank Q3 seen under pressure from tech weakness, Arm IPO eyed
2023-02-03T07:56:52Z
TOKYO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's (9984.T) quarterly earnings on Tuesday are set to show persistent pressure from tech valuations that have yet to recover from a global sell-off, adding to the uncertain outlook for the timing of the highly anticipated Arm listing.

The Japanese tech giant's planned listing of British chip designer Arm, one of the crown jewels of Masayoshi Son's sprawling conglomerate, is seen as crucial to improving SoftBank's financial performance and boosting shareholder returns.

SoftBank has said the initial public offering (IPO) is unlikely to take place during the current business year that ends in March due to market conditions. But it aims to take the company public by the end of calendar 2023.

""What's important is pressing ahead with Arm's IPO, carrying out exit plans for other investments, and then, through those steps, improving financial standing and delivering shareholder returns,"" SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Satoru Kikuchi said.

SoftBank is expected to post a net profit of 103.7 billion yen ($806.13 million) for the latest quarter, according to analysts' average estimate compiled by Refinitiv. That compares with a 29 billion yen profit a year earlier.

SoftBank reported a 3 trillion yen profit in July-September, although those results were boosted by the sale of some of its stake in Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group Holding (9988.HK) and followed two straight quarters of losses.

SoftBank bought Arm, whose technology underpins the global smartphone industry and is used in supercomputers, for $32 billion in 2016.

It is pushing ahead with plans to list Arm following the collapse of a sale to Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) in an IPO that could value the company at as much as $60 billion, Reuters has reported. read more

One notable change to SoftBank's quarterly announcement this time around is the lack of founder and chief executive Masayoshi Son's colourful presentation, which has been a regular feature of SoftBank's earnings disclosure.

Son said in November he would not be speaking at such briefings for the foreseeable future as he focuses on driving Arm's growth.

Investors will also be watching closely whether SoftBank announces a fresh share buyback scheme, along with the third quarter results.

On the day of its first quarter earnings announcement in August, SoftBank said it planned to buy back up to 400 billion yen worth of its own shares, but did not announce a new buyback plan at the time of its second quarter earnings in November, helping send its shares down 13% in the next trading day."
"Glimmers of Change Emerge on List of Top 50 Donors
2023-02-17T23:02:00Z
The Chronicle of Philanthropy’s annual list of the top 50 donors—with Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Michael Bloomberg leading the ranking—reveals the makeup of the nation’s top givers is still dominated by older men who made their money in finance, tech, and real estate, and whose giving is dominated by donations to universities and medical research and institutions.

In all, the top 50 donors gave US$16 billion to nonprofits, private foundations, and donor-advised funds last year. That’s down from US$35.6 billion in 2021, although that year’s total included a US$15 billion pledge by Gates to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In the height of the pandemic, in 2020, giving by the top 50 reached US$24.7 billion, according to the Chronicle.

The annual list does show glimmers of change, however. For one thing, 26 donors on the list are new, including Boston Pops clarinetist Edward Avedisian (No. 20 on the list), whose stock trading hobby enabled him to give US$100 million to Boston University in honor of his friend, former BU president Aram Chobanian, before he died in December, the Chronicle said.

Yes, traditional gifts to universities such as Avedisian’s were prevalent, but several donors sought to make an impact on areas of interest to them even through conventional donations.

For example, Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff and his wife, Lynne, (tied for No. 33) gave US$60 million to the University of California at Santa Barbara for ocean science, while Nvidia Corp. founder Jen-Hsun Huang and his wife, Lori, (No. 41) gave US$50 million to the Oregon State University Foundation for a new research center to apply artificial intelligence to climate science, the Chronicle said.

Others such as retired employee-relations executive John Metz and his husband, Ali Khan, No. 44 on the list, focused on equity and diversity. Metz and Kahn gave US$46 million to Metz’s alma mater, Miami University of Ohio, for scholarship aid to students from low-income families.

“We’re beginning to see increasing amounts of donors wanting their significant support to alma maters being about key impact areas in the world in addition to supporting an important and beloved institution,” says William Foster, managing partner at the Bridgespan Group.

Also, Foster noted, university donations may be more likely to show up on a list like this because wealthy donors often give to their alma maters outside of their private foundations, which are established to deliver on specific goals. “If you write a check to the alma mater, that undermines the strategy or mission of the foundation,” he says.

Mae Hong, a vice president at Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, noted the wide range of gifts on the list, with both former energy company CEO Murry Gerber and appellate lawyer David Frederick and his wife, Sophia Lynn, landing at No. 50 with Gerber and Frederick each giving US$40 million—significant donations but far less than the US$5.1 billion from Gates, in the No. 1 spot.

Although the list was dominated by gifts to universities and medical research and institutions—aside from gifts to foundations—Hong noted a couple instances of donors farther down the list who gave large sums to small nonprofits.

“US$1 million to a small nonprofit has so much more impact than US$100 million to Harvard [University],” she says.

Another fact that jumped out to Hong was that Huang, a Taiwanese American, was the only person of color this year in the top 50.

“There’s really nobody of color on the list,” Hong says. “There are people who have been immigrants and have immigrant backgrounds, but primarily it is a list dominated by whites. That is really surprising given how much attention is being paid to new and significant wealth in communities of color.”

In many ways the top 50 ranking doesn’t reveal the priorities of wealthy givers, although the Chronicle provides information where available on their grantmaking. Bridgespan, for instance, is finding donors are making “increasing levels of big gifts to tough social change issues” that aren’t all showing up on top donor lists, Foster says.

"Stocks struggle to make headway as rate rises loom

NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Global equities and crude oil rebounded from earlier losses on Thursday even as economic data continued to show the strength of the U.S. economy and validated the Federal Reserve's tight monetary policy stance.

A U.S. Labor Department report on Thursday showed that new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to a persistently tight labor market.

The readings for the fourth-quarter personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, were revised upward to 3.7%, indicating inflation was much stronger than initially thought and weighed on sentiment earlier in the day.

Minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting released on Wednesday showed that officials favored a moderation in the pace of rate hikes although they indicated that containing high inflation would be key in how much further rates need to rise.

""The Fed minutes yesterday were a bit hawkish and they said ongoing rate hikes would be necessary and that should obviously be negative for the market,"" said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co in New Orleans.

""But it seems the market is starting to discount that we're getting into the eighth or ninth inning of these rate hikes even though the Fed is saying ongoing rate hikes would be necessary,"" Villere said.

The MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 50 countries, was down 0.27%. European stocks (.STOXX) were up at just 0.06%.

On Wall Street, the Nasdaq regained earlier losses from better-than-expected revenue at chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O). The results drove the company's shares up 14%, along with shares of other semiconductor manufacturers.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 0.33% to 33,153.91, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 0.53% to 4,012.32 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 0.72% to 11,590.40.

""When you see strong numbers at certain companies, it could be market moving and that's what we're seeing today - a bit of a relief rally,"" Villere added.

Oil prices firmed more than 1% before paring some gains, with Russian supply curbs partially offsetting an expected rise in U.S. inventories.

Brent crude futures settled up 2% to $82.21 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) advanced 2% to $75.39 after six sessions of losses.

U.S. Treasury yields edged lower in choppy trading, with those on the 10-year pulling back from three-month highs, as investors have priced in strong economic data.

Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were down at 3.8865%, while the yield curve measuring the gap between the two- and 10-year Treasury notes was still inverted at minus 77.90 basis points, indicating a looming recession.

The dollar retained its strength against its major peers. The dollar index rose 0.077%, with the euro down 0.07% to $1.0594.

Safe-haven gold prices slipped to their lowest in about two months as the U.S. dollar climbed. Spot gold dropped 0.03% to $1,822.09 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures fell 0.55% to $1,822.00 an ounce.

"Wall St Week Ahead Last year's laggards lead U.S. stocks' 2023 rebound, for now
2023-02-11T00:16:58Z
NEW YORK, Feb 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks that took a beating last year are surging in the early weeks of 2023, leading markets higher. Some investors believe that trend is unlikely to last.

Stunning gains in shares of companies such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) are lifting sectors that struggled in last year’s selloff, including technology (.SPLRCT), and communication services (.SPLRCL).

Smaller stocks that tumbled in 2022 have also burst out of the gate: a Goldman Sachs basket of unprofitable tech stocks that tumbled over 60% in 2022 has rebounded 21% in 2023, dwarfing the S&P 500’s 6.5% gain.

A range of factors are driving the moves, including the attractiveness of beaten-up shares, a tailwind from falling bond yields and market participants unwinding bearish bets against stocks.

Some investors, however, are skeptical that the gains will last, especially if markets continue recalibrating expectations for how high the Federal Reserve will need to raise rates this year to keep cooling off inflation.

While it’s not unusual to see a reversal of trends to begin a year, ""the extent to which it’s occurred is pretty dramatic,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital. “It certainly can’t continue at the extremes it has been.”

Greenwood Capital recently sold at least a portion of its shares in some 2023 winners, including Meta Platforms and Netflix. Meta is up 45% so far this year, while Netflix is up almost 18%. Those stocks fell 64% and 51% last year, respectively.

The S&P 500 jumped 6.2% in January as many investors rushed to raise their equity positioning after whittling it down last year, encouraged by several months of easing inflation readings. One measure, equity positioning for systematic investors, has climbed to its highest in a year, according to a report from Deutsche Bank issued Feb 3.

Moderating bond yields, which surged in 2022 as the Fed raised interest rates to fight soaring inflation, bolstered the case for scooping up last year's losers. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell about 40 basis points during the first few weeks of the year to 3.4% at the start of February after reaching 15-year highs last year.

While falling yields often increase the allure of equities in general, they are particularly beneficial for the technology and growth stocks whose valuations suffered when yields shot higher in 2022.

“When interest rates fall, lower quality, longer duration assets do well,"" said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management.

Yields have headed higher again in recent days, however, as investors raised estimates for how high the Fed will lift rates and how long the central bank will keep them at peak levels. That's weighed on stocks in the latest week, which saw the S&P 500 lose 1.1% after two straight weeks of gains.

""The market leaders to-date ... are vulnerable to the higher-for-longer interest rates and a slowing economy,"" strategists at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a note Thursday. ""We do not view the recent breadth and leadership as sustainable -- yet -- and prefer not to chase equity rallies at this time.""

Investors will be closely watching Tuesday's release of U.S. consumer price data for signs that inflation is continuing to moderate.

David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, is skeptical of the latest rally and some of the stocks leading the current run. His firm is underweight many of the big tech and growth stocks that have rebounded in 2023, preferring healthcare and defense shares and keeping a big allocation in cash.

“Either the deterioration last year from an overvalued space is over, or this is a dead cat bounce in a wounded large sector and the bear market of last year is not over,"" Kotok said. ""I am in the latter camp.”

To be sure, there are some signs the leaders could continue to do well.

Since 1990, the three best-performing sectors in January went on to post an average return of 11.3% over the next 12 months versus the S&P 500’s average gain of 9.3% over that time, according to investment research firm CFRA Research.

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

For markets increasingly wary of the inflation and interest rate implications of re-accelerating world growth, the positive of a new burst of economic confidence in the tech sector adds some cheer at least.

The new year craze in artificial intelligence and chatbots seems to have electrified chip designer Nvidia (NVDA.O), whose stock surged more than 8% before the bell after it forecast first-quarter revenue above Wall St estimates late Wednesday.

Its CEO Jensen Huang said use of its chips to power AI had ""gone through the roof in the last 60 days.""

The world's largest supplier of chips used in data centers for training AI has become a key hardware supplier for large tech companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) that are building services like chat-powered search engines.

Chip stocks rose around the world on Thursday in the slipstream of Nvidia's earnings report. S&P500 stock futures jumped about 0.5% and back above 4,000 points ahead of the open.

If the AI boom is one vignette in a world economy that appears to be skirting widely-forecast recession and regenerating some momentum, then the interest rate implications are considerable - not just in how high they go, but how long they stay up there.

The Federal Reserve at least seems keen on the higher-for-longer message that's shaken world stock and bond markets this week.

While most Fed policymakers rallied behind a decision to further slow the pace of interest rate hikes at its last policy meeting - suggesting some still saw another half-point rate rise as warranted - minutes from the meeting showed they all saw curbing unacceptably high inflation as the ""key factor"".

Bond yields rose following the release of the minutes and the U.S. dollar also advanced.

And as the minutes pre-date red-hot jobs and retail data for January, the message from Fed officials is probably even sterner now. New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams on Wednesday said the Fed is ""absolutely"" committed to bringing inflation back down to its 2% target over the next few years, by bringing demand down in line with constrained supply.

The signals from other central banks were similar. Bank of England interest rate-setter Catherine Mann said on Thursday that it was too soon to sound the all clear on inflation and the BoE should continue to raise borrowing costs.

Investors seem to be taking all that on board. A Reuters poll of equity analysts showed global stock markets are expected to correct in the next three months.

The Feb. 10-22 poll of more than 150 strategists, analysts and fund mangers covering 17 global stock indices, found that 56% were expecting their local market to fall in the next three months. A total of 48 out of 86 respondents said the chances of a correction were either high or very high.

But well chosen recovery stocks continue to do well. British engineering firm Rolls-Royce (RR.L) surged 18.1% on Thursday after the company's CEO forecast more profit growth in 2023 after last year's beat. A key factor was optimism around civil aerospace, the firm's biggest division, as travel recovers from the pandemic.

"ChatGPT's massive hype has made these 5 artificial intelligence stocks some of the hottest on the market
2023-01-31T20:52:45Z
• The success of ChatGPT has sparked a rally in artificial intelligence stocks.
• Shares of AI tech suppliers like Nvidia and Ambarella have jumped since the launch of ChatGPT.
• Here's a list of five AI stocks that have surged since OpenAI launched ChatGPT on November 30.
Everyone is talking about ChatGPT, and investors are trading on the hype, sending both notable and under-the-radar artificial intelligence stocks soaring since the bot launched.
On November 30, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT, and since then it has shown a capacity for a range of tasks, such as writing stock stories, layoff emails, and even dating-app messages.
The buzz has exploded, and OpenAI is getting a reported $10 billion investment from Microsoft. While OpenAI isn't traded on public markets, artificial intelligence stocks that are public have been riding the wave.
Here's a list of five AI stocks that have seen a surge since November 29, the last trading day before ChatGPT launched.
Nvidia, best known for its design and production of graphics-processing chips, is embedded in the artificial intelligence craze, and the firm's technology is used for various AI integrations from self-driving cars to robots.
The Nvidia stock rally has also made founder and CEO Jensen Huang considerably richer as his wealth has grown by more than $5 billion so far this year, Bloomberg data shows.
Wall Street is also bullish. Citigroup analysts recently estimated that a boom in ChatGPT usage could translate to $3 billion-$11 billion in sales for Nvidia in the next 12 months. ""We believe Nvidia has in ChatGPT a potentially meaningful compute demand driver,"" the bank said.
Meanwhile, analysts at Bank of America said Nvidia is a top potential winner from generative AI growth, and Wells Fargo said new chips from Nvidia are poised to gain from greater computing needs of AI tools like ChatGPT.
Ambarella is another chip company that serves the AI market. It designs semiconductors that are used in everything from entertainment consoles in cars to cellphones.
It also specializes in ""system on a chip"" semiconductors that combine multiple central processors on one logic board to provide artificial intelligence computing.
Ambarella chips are used in self-driving functions, and the company recently partnered with German auto supplier Continental on an autonomous driving venture.
Mobileye was spun off by Intel and focuses on self-driving technology and driver-assistance systems, including chips and cameras. Volkswagen, Ford, and GM are among its customers. The company has a near-fully autonomous system called SuperVision, and its Chauffeur product is designed to convert a car into a Level 4 self-driven vehicle.
Last week, the company beat quarterly forecasts and gave an upbeat 2023 revenue projection. CEO Amnon Shashua touted roughly $17 billion worth of bookings that extends through 2030.
""We expect SuperVision to be a very large growth driver in 2023 and beyond,"" he told analysts on an earnings call.
C3.ai is an artificial intelligence software suite provider, and has the success of ChatGPT to thank for its recent stock surge. Shares soared roughly 28% on Tuesday alone on news that it would integrate ChatGPT into its product suite.
""The C3 Generative AI Product Suite integrates the latest AI capabilities from organizations such as Open AI, Google, and academia, and the most advanced models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 into C3 AI's enterprise AI products,"" C3.ai said in a Tuesday press release.
Alteryx's software is best known for data and analytics, and the firm is also focused on furthering automation. The firm specializes in artificial intelligence integration, although on a smaller scale compared peers like Google and Meta.
The company will report quarterly results on February 9."
"2 Chip Stocks to Buy Instead of NVIDIA In 2023
2023-01-30T14:45:11Z
The performance of the chip industry was marred last year in the face of macroeconomic headwinds, supply chain constraints spurred by the Russia-Ukraine war, and escalating tensions between the United States and China. Last year, the United States imposed stringent restrictions on chip exports.
In September 2022, chip giant NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) was blocked by the U.S. government from exporting two of its top computing chips, A100 and H100 graphic processing units, for artificial intelligence (AI) work to China. The company said the ban impacted $400 million in sales of the affected chips to China that could be lost if firms decide not to buy alternative NVDA products.
Moreover, in terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, NVDA is trading at 62.33x, which is 209.6% higher than the 20.14x industry average. Also, analysts expect its EPS and revenue to decline 39.3% and 21.2% year-over-year to $0.80 and $6.02 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter ending January 2023.
On the bright side, President Joe Biden signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act, which is aimed to bolster chip manufacturing in the United States and further advance research and development in the domestic semiconductor industry."
"The stock market is facing a make-or-break week as investors try to hold onto the latest rally amid Fed moves and big-name earnings
2023-01-30T17:57:19Z
Specifically, the S&P 500's breakout above resistance of 4,020 last week won't be confirmed unless the index closes this Friday above 4,050, Stockton said in a Monday note. The S&P 500 currently trades at about 4,040.
""A short-term overbought downturn cautions against positioning for upside follow-through prematurely. If a breakout is confirmed, next resistance is [about] 4,225,"" Stockton said of the S&P 500.
A jump to that level represents potential upside of 5% from current levels.
Nvidia is another large-cap stock to watch this week, as it needs to close above $188 this Friday to confirm last week's breakout.
""Should it hold above $188 through Friday, a breakout would be confirmed in a market positive, whereas a failed breakout would be a setback,"" Stockton said. Nvidia traded around $196 on Monday.
But a lot could happen between now and the closing bell on Friday, as market-shaking news is expected from the Federal Reserve and mega-cap tech earnings."
"Wall Street's expectations for AI's influence on markets are skyrocketing, JPMorgan survey says
2023-02-01T17:50:04Z
• Amid the recent hype surrounding ChatGPT, Wall Street increasingly anticipates artificial intelligence will change how markets operate.
• A JPMorgan survey found that 53% of traders believe AI will be the technology with the biggest influence on future trading.
• That figure is more than double what the survey found a year ago.
Amid the recent hype surrounding ChatGPT, Wall Street increasingly anticipates artificial intelligence will change how markets operate.
A JPMorgan survey found that 53% of institutional traders believe AI or machine learning will be the technology that has the biggest influence on trading over the next three years. Last year, only 25% of survey respondents held that view.
""We continue to see strong momentum towards electronic trading, as seen by 100% of survey respondents predicting an increase in electronic trading over the coming years,"" Scott Wacker, JPMorgan's global head of FICC e-sales, said in a statement included in the survey.
To be sure, AI technology has been revolutionizing Wall Street for years. For example, the vast majority of trades are already executed by algorithms.
And many asset managers have been using some type of AI, according to Bloomberg Intelligence's 2022 US Institutional Equity Trading study.
But since OpenAI's language tool ChatGPT broke onto the scene in November, the bot has proven competent in writing articles, dating-app messages, and emails, giving rise to predictions on which jobs could soon be replaced by AI.
""We're seeing a lot of new entrants in the fixed income market which is really pushing the electronic agenda for the whole industry,"" Wacker maintained. ""It's an exciting time for the electronic and automation space right now, as we look to offer clients added choice of execution options.""
Meanwhile, the hype created by ChatGPT has sent artificial intelligence stocks like Nvidia surging recently. The craze has even sent some obscure small-cap artificial intelligence stocks soaring too."
"Intel's 'historic collapse' sparks selloff in chip stocks - Reuters.com

2023-01-27T12:24:00Z
Intel Corp (INTC.O) saw about $8 billion wiped off its market value on Friday after the U.S. chipmaker stumped Wall Street with dismal earnings projections, fanning fears around a slump in the personal-computer market.
The company predicted a surprise loss for the first quarter and its revenue forecast was $3 billion below estimates as it also struggled with slowing growth in the data center business.
Intel shares closed 6.4% lower, while rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) ended the session up 0.3% and 2.8%, respectively. Intel supplier KLA Corp (KLAC.O) settled 6.9% lower after its dismal forecast.
""No words can portray or explain the historic collapse of Intel,"" said Rosenblatt Securities' Hans Mosesmann, who was among the 21 analysts to cut their price targets on the stock.
The poor outlook underscored the challenges facing Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger as he tries to reestablish Intel's dominance of the sector by expanding contract manufacturing and building new factories in the United States and Europe.
The company has been steadily losing market share to rivals like AMD, which has used contract chipmakers such as Taiwan-based TSMC (2330.TW) to make chips that outpace Intel's technology.
""AMD's Genoa and Bergamo (data center) chips have a strong price-performance advantage compared to Intel's Sapphire Rapids processors, which should drive further AMD share gains,"" said Matt Wegner, analyst at YipitData.
Analysts said that puts Intel at a disadvantage even when the data center market bottoms out, expected in the second half of 2022, as the company would have lost even more share by then.
""It is now clear why Intel needs to cut so much cost as the company's original plans prove to be fantasy,"" brokerage Bernstein said.
""The magnitude of the deterioration is stunning, and brings potential concern to the company's cash position over time.""
Intel, which plans to cut $3 billion in costs this year, generated $7.7 billion in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and paid dividends of $1.5 billion.
With capital expenditure estimated to be around $20 billion in 2023, analysts said the company should consider cutting its dividend."
"C3.ai surges 30% to cap off a winning week for many AI stocks and ETFs as ChatGPT frenzy spreads across the market
2023-02-03T19:20:13Z
• C3.ai shares soared Friday and were headed higher for the week alongside other AI-tied stocks and ETFs
• The frenzy surrounding ChatGPT has contributed to C3.ai shares more than doubling in 2023.
• Nvidia and Ambarella are also among this week's advancers.
C3.ai stock rallied to its highest in a year Friday, highlighting a jump in some AI stocks and funds this week as the popularity of the ChatGPT tool spurs investors to run toward exposure to artificial intelligence.
C3.ai climbed as much as 30% to $28.48 during Friday's session, notching a 52-week high for shares of the business AI software maker.
""The hype surrounding Artificial Intelligence has spilled over into retail investments,"" said Vanda Research in a note Thursday.
Investors have been pushing into AI-related assets as the buzz surrounding the ChatGPT language bot from OpenAI has been accelerating for weeks. The chatbot displays a human-like ability to perform work like addressing investment questions to writing layoff emails.
C3.ai's share price over the past five days has bulked up about 50%. The stock's value has more than doubled in 2023, with this week's push coming after C3.ai said it would integrate ChatGPT into its lineup of AI tools.
Also headed toward gains this week was Nvidia, up nearly 5%. It was also looking at a year-to-date advance of 46%. Technology from the company, known for its graphics-processing chips, is used for AI integrations including self-driving cars and robots.
Ambarella, a chip designer that serves the AI market, has also picked up about 5% this week and its 2023 gain was hovering around 15%.
Among exchange-traded funds, the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF and the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF were up roughly 3% and 4% this week. The AI Powered Equity ETF was tracking a more modest rise of 1% but it's bulked up by 15% so far this year.
Vanda Research, which tracks activity among retail investors, said the surge of net inflows into C3.ai stock this week made it among the top 10 most bought securities in US markets. But it also sounded a note of caution. 
""Although the strong momentum in Google search trend suggests that there could be appetite for additional buying, we expect to see a slowdown in purchases in the weeks ahead, as interest in the [AI] topic will likely begin to fade."""
"Stumbling Intel, seeing AMD gain ground, says it will recover balance - Reuters.com
2023-01-27T04:41:00Z
Microprocessor giant Intel Corp (INTC.O) says it will regain its footing against AMD and other chip rivals which are gobbling up market share, but Wall Street is skeptical.
The company shocked the market on Thursday with a revenue outlook that was short of Wall Street estimates by about $3 billion. The challenge from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) is playing out as tech spending slumps globally, complicating Intel's efforts to clear a record inventory glut.
Intel is still the 300-pound gorilla in the market of microprocessors, called central processing units (CPUs), the brains of computers. It says it has passed through the worst of a revamp under a new chief executive.
""We lost share, we lost momentum. We think that stabilizes this year,"" Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told investors on a conference call.
However, business tech spending is falling sharply as customers are wary of a recession, and consumer electronics demand has slumped after surging through the COVID-19 pandemic. That's a headwind for Intel and AMD, both of which are rolling out new chips, but Intel is facing a larger inventory correction.
The company reported $13.2 billion in inventories, equal to about 151 days of inventory, according to Bernstein analysts.
Intel still dominates the markets for PC and server processing chips, with a market share greater than 70%, tech research firm IDC calculated. But that is down from more than 90% in 2017.
""I don't think Intel is in a position yet to start recovering share. Someone going from 1% to 13% is significant. It tells you that now there's a viable second competitor in the server processor market, who has momentum and is gaining momentum,"" said Rau.
That competitor is AMD, which under the leadership of Chief Executive Lisa Su has come back from the brink of bankruptcy and has been taking business away from Intel quarter after quarter.
A few years ago, there was a yawning gap between the two company's market valuations. Now, they are both roughly valued at $120 billion, even though AMD's revenues for the 12 months through September were $22.8 billion, far short of Intel's $70 billion. AMD reports results next Tuesday.
Chipmaker shares were hammered across the board on Friday, but Intel led the decline, slumping by 10% while AMD lost 1.8%.
Purchasers of processors cannot launch products if new chip designs are late, and Intel has stumbled on delivering its latest data-center chip, code-named Sapphire Rapids.
""Intel had high hopes that Sapphire Rapids would enable them to take the fight to AMD,"" said Lucas Keh, semiconductors analyst at Third Bridge. ""However, our experts say that it has been a disappointment so far because of Intel’s continuous inconsistency in delivery.""
Worse for Intel, the benchmarks published by the two companies show that AMD's latest server chip outperforms Sapphire Rapids on ""general purpose workloads,"" according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.
Intel has other rising competitors, too. Graphics chip maker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) is branching out into central processors and former processor customers, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), are designing their own chips.
CEO Gelsinger said that 2023 would be a year of stabilizing then re-acceleration. Intel had taken some painful steps and now needed to execute on a good plan, he said.
""Intel's turnaround is taking some time, exacerbated by the economy, but I believe its plan is working,"" said Glenn O'Donnell, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""It is delivering on new products and its manufacturing is ramping up with agreements from other chipmakers to use Intel's manufacturing capacity."""
"Your Digital Self: The old reliable laptop is getting a makeover and could be tech’s next new thing
2023-01-23T16:06:00Z
The consumer electronics industry is getting new life from an old product: laptops.
Although the changes are evolutionary rather than revolutionary, they’re substantial enough to make the laptop sector more competitive with the desktop PC sector of the market.
This is especially significant as global PC sales tumbled 19.5% in the third quarter of 2022 — the largest decline since consulting firm Gartner began tracking sales in the mid-1990s. When you consider supply-chain issues, global economic crises and the crypto craze that took desktop graphic card prices sky-high last year, this is hardly surprising.
In 2022, this lack of demand created a vacuum, and laptops are about to fill it. But these machines will need powerful CPUs and GPUs, and earlier this month at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), consumers got a good look at what’s coming.
Nvidia NVDA, , AMD AMD, and Intel INTC, each showcased their own powerful mobile technology. Nvidia’s RTX 4000 mobile GPUs offer a more varied selection than the desktop versions. Intel’s Core i9-13980HX is the first 24-core laptop CPU that can be overclocked to 5.6GHz. Meanwhile, AMD’s Ryzen 7000 mobile processors focus on high-end performance while keeping low power consumption. Nvidia’s RTX 4000 mobile GPUs with DLSS 3 upscaling technology aim to make affordable and mid-range gaming laptops handle even the most graphically demanding games. Intel’s Core i9-13980HX also has the potential to narrow the performance gap between laptops and high-end desktop PCs.
AMD’s Ryzen 7000 mobile processors with integrated RDNA 3 graphics could also create a generation of affordable laptops capable of running more PC games without a discrete GPU, which would help keep prices down and prolong battery life.
While many of the laptops on display were simply updated versions of their predecessors, these stood out:
Acer 2353, Predator Helios 16 and 18 are excellent options for gamers looking for a balance of power and portability. Both models are equipped with Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs, 13th-generation Intel i7 or i9 CPUs, and boast high-resolution screens with a maximum refresh rate of 240Hz. They also come equipped with ample storage and memory, which makes them ideal for running today’s latest and greatest games.
Alienware m18 is a cutting-edge gaming laptop that is pushing the boundaries of possible in terms of screen size. It offers options of either 165Hz at 2560 x 1600 resolution or 480Hz at 1920 x 1200 resolution and includes the latest technology — Intel, Nvidia and/or AMD chips, up to 64GB of memory, and 9TB of storage. However, at $2,899 (starting for Intel CPU & Nvidia GPU), the price point is quite steep.
Asus 2357, ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 boasts a unique design with two screens — a traditional display and one above the keyboard. The laptop comes equipped with the latest AMD CPUs and Nvidia GPUs, a 240Hz QHD+ screen, and ample storage and memory.
HP’s HPQ, Omen 17 offers great flexibility with multiple configurations to choose from. The top-of-the-line version includes Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series GPU, a 13th-gen Intel i9 CPU, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD storage, and a high-resolution and refresh rate screen of 2560×1440 and 240Hz.
Lenovo 992, LNVGY, Legion Pro 7i is a sleek and durable option with Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs, 13th-gen Intel CPUs, and high-resolution and refresh rate screens. However, its configurations options are rather limited.
The MSI Cyborg 15 is a powerful gaming model that features Intel Core i9-11900H processor, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 graphics, and a 1440p, 300Hz display. It also includes lightning-fast storage and memory, a mechanical keyboard, and Thunderbolt 4 connectivity.
Unfortunately, while each of these models are impressive stats-wise, they offer little in regard to innovation. The same can be said for their business-use counterparts presented at the event, with a few notable exceptions:
Lenovo Yoga Book 9i 2 in 1 with two 13.3-inch, Dolby Vision-powered screens is the first full-sized OLED dual-screen laptop. (The screens can be used in tandem, one on top of the other or side by side, depending on the user’s needs). Under the hood, the model boasts Intel 13th-gen Core i7-U15 processors and can support 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of storage. Priced at $2,100, it is expected in June of 2023.

"Sorry investors, the AI hype that's gripped the stock market is premature and the bubble will probably burst this year
2023-02-11T13:15:00Z
• ChatGPT has drummed up too much hype around AI, according to Ned Davis Research strategist Pat Tschosik.
• Tschosik says frenzied investing in obscure AI companies reminds him the 2001 dot-com boom and bust.
• The rally in AI stocks will probably run until about mid-year before stock prices return to earth, he said.
Sorry investors, you might be jumping the gun on your rush to snap up anything related to the budding world of artificial intelligence, and you should be prepared for the bubble to burst this year.
Wall Street in recent weeks has become fixated on the potential for AI to reshape whole industries, and the corresponding moves in a handful of stocks that are even just adjacent to the space have been huge.
But to one analyst, the hype is overblown, at least for now.
""Is there too much hype? I do think there's some froth and that you'll see some of these stocks come down after a little bit,"" Pat Tschosik, US sector strategist at Ned Davis Research told Insider, noting that artificial intelligence stocks may only see a boost from the ChatGPT hype for another few months.
ChatGPT — the buzzy AI bot that can write sophisticated prose on a range of topics — was released last November and immediately made headlines on Main Street and Wall Street.
Microsoft stock has surged 12.5% this year as the company expands its partnership with ChatGPT's parent, and Buzzfeed stock briefly soared over 200% when it said it would use ChatGPT to write content on its website. But even tiny companies with little discernible business in AI have seen a boost from small updates related to the technology. But while Tschosik is bullish himself on the long-term future of artificial intelligence, he warned that there are two reasons why investors may be getting carried away with the latest craze.
First, there aren't a lot of contenders in the AI space to choose from, and there's no way to invest directly in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This means some obscure artificial intelligence companies could easily be getting overvalued.
In an experiment, Tschosik asked ChatGPT to list the best artificial intelligence stocks. The bot spit out a small but basically accurate list of competitors: Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon. With such a small pool, obscure AI stocks have been getting outsized attention from Wall Street investors, helping boost prices higher than they might otherwise go if the sector was more developed.
He pointed to C3.ai, the small artificial intelligence-focused company whose stock has skyrocketed over 176% this year amid the popularity of ChatGPT.
""I think these companies are getting a very large premium, if you're seen as a pure play on artificial intelligence technology,"" he said.
His second concern is that most AI companies are still in the early stages of implementing ChatGPT or other AI into their platforms, and it's unclear when these efforts will become profitable.
""I think the future of artificial intelligence is very bright, and it's a matter of discovering what you can do with hese bots to actually generate revenue … I am just starting to question how long does it take these companies to really make money and get profitable from these bots,"" he said.
The AI craze, Tschosik says, bears resemblance to the dot-com bubble, which sent the Nasdaq down 20% when it finally burst. The stock market recovered, though some companies never returned to the highs of that era.
""Get a web address and come up with a business plan of how you're going to take over the world, and you're valued at a crazy amount of money,"" he said of the 2001 era. ""I don't think it will reach that type of froth, but I do think that it's very easy to run up these companies' valuations before there's any real profitability.""
Tschosik gives it six months before some of the hype surrounding AI dies down, and he attributes much of the upward movement in AI stocks to the fact that the market is simply doing well in general in 2023.
""That would be my best estimate as to how long these could run before they come back to earth,"" he warned

"Wall St Week Ahead Tech stock rebound faces doubters with ... - Reuters
2023-01-20T15:40:00Z
A spate of earnings reports in coming weeks is set to test a recent bounce in technology and other megacap stocks, a category whose leadership position in U.S. markets has faltered after last year’s deep selloff.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index (.NDX) has gained nearly 6.2% in 2023, compared to a 3.45% rise for the S&P 500 (.SPX). Shares of some megacap companies - which include those grouped outside of tech in sectors like communication services and consumer discretionary - have shot higher, with Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta Platforms (META.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) posting double-digit percentage increases.
Several factors are driving that outperformance, including investors piling into stocks they believe were overly punished in 2022. A moderation in bond yields, whose jump last year particularly pressured tech-stock valuations, is also likely helping the group, investors said.
Now, however, the focus is shifting to whether these companies can withstand a widely expected economic downturn while supporting valuations that some investors believe are too high.
""To keep this rebound going, the guidance for ’23 has to be less worse than what people are anticipating,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, whose firm recently pared its holdings in Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).
Tech and growth stocks led U.S. equity markets for years following the 2008 financial crisis, aided by near-zero interest rates. They struggled along with broader markets last year as the Federal Reserve raised rates to fight surging inflation, and some investors doubt they will regain the market's pole position any time soon. The Nasdaq 100 fell 33% in 2022, while the S&P 500 lost 19.4%.
The top six stocks by market value in late 2021 - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Amazon, Meta and Tesla (TSLA.O) - have seen their collective weight in the S&P 500 fall from 25% to 18%, according to Strategas Research Partners.
That dynamic echoes a pattern seen after the market’s dot-com bubble burst after the turn of the century. The six biggest stocks at that time saw their collective weight in the S&P 500 decline to 5% from a peak of 17% over a number of years, according to Strategas.
""This leadership unwind ... is going to be one that is measured in years, not in months or quarters,"" said Chris Verrone, head of technical and macro research at Strategas.
Companies comprising over half the S&P 500's market value are due to report results in the next two weeks, including Microsoft, the second-largest U.S. company by market value, on Tuesday, Elon Musk's Tesla and IBM (IBM.N) on Wednesday and Intel (INTC.O) on Thursday. Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, and Google-parent Alphabet report the following week.
Fourth-quarter earnings in the tech sector are expected to have declined 9.1% from a year ago, compared to a 2.8% decline for S&P 500 earnings overall, according to Refinitiv IBES.
A critical question for many megacaps, once heralded for their stellar growth, is whether they can increase revenue and profits significantly while cutting costs in the face of a possible recession.
Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) said Friday it is cutting about 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its workforce, the latest tech giant to announce layoffs. Microsoft on Wednesday said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs while Amazon started notifying employees of its own 18,000-person job cuts.
""The biggest positive could be if they could show a control of expenses while keeping at least reasonable growth intact,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""It’s a hard balancing act.""
Valuations for tech and megacap companies have moderated after last year's selloff, though they still stand above those of the broader market. The S&P 500 tech sector still trades at a roughly 19% premium to the broader index, above its 7% average of the past 10 years, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
Nonetheless, some investors are reluctant to bet against tech stocks.

"Why Nvidia Stock Jumped 34% in January
2023-02-09T03:17:49Z
Shares of Nvidia (NVDA -4.80%), the chip maker best known for its graphics processors, were soaring last month as the company seemed to benefit from a broader turnaround in tech stocks and as interest built in all things artificial intelligence (AI)-related following the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT.
According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished the month up 34%.
As you can see from the chart below, the stock gained steadily over the course of the month, significantly outpacing the Nasdaq, which jumped 11%.
There was little company-specific news out on Nvidia last month, but after the stock plunged 50% last year, investors seemed to spy a buying opportunity as market sentiment shifted in January.
Another Consumer Price Index report showing the inflation rate continuing to come down encouraged investors that the market could rebound without a deep recession, and confidence built that the Federal Reserve would slow down its interest rate hikes. At its meeting on Feb. 1, it did just that when it raised rates by just 25 basis points, its lowest increase in nearly a year.
Nvidia shares also seemed to move higher as interest surged in artificial intelligence following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November and as Microsoft and Alphabet both declared a pivot to AI, signaling that a new tech race was on in chat-powered search and other AI categories.
AI stocks like C3.ai also jumped toward the end of the month, and Nvidia seemed to catch a tailwind because it's generally considered the leader in AI chips. A majority of its revenue also comes from chips for data centers, which are expected to be in high demand as AI becomes the next frontier in technology.
Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and revenue is falling across the board due to an inventory glut. Recent reports from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices made clear that the fourth quarter is likely to be a challenging one for Nvidia.
Still, the company once again seems to be at the right place at the right time in the chip sector and is likely to benefit from the boom in artificial intelligence.
We'll learn more when Nvidia reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 22. Analysts are expecting another decline in revenue, calling for the top line to slide 21.4% to $6.01 billion and earnings per share to shrink from $1.32 to $0.81. However, investors will also be keen to hear management's comments on the evolution of AI, as that will be a greater determinant of the company's long-term performance."
"Better Growth Stock: Nvidia vs. Apple
2023-02-10T11:15:00Z
Tech stocks have been on the rise in 2023 after a sell-off the previous year. Investors are bullish over the prospects of swiftly developing industries such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality, and what they could mean for the companies actively pursuing them.
Nvidia (NVDA -4.80%) and Apple (AAPL 0.25%) suffered stock slides in 2022 alongside macroeconomic headwinds. However, the new year has Wall Street optimistic, with both stocks up over 20% since Jan. 1.
As these tech stocks begin to recover, now might be an excellent time to invest in one of these high-growth companies. So, is Nvidia or Apple's stock the better buy? Let's take a look.
Nvidia shares plunged 50% throughout 2022 as consumer demand for PC components slipped. While the company's majority market share in discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) has propelled it into a position of dominance in the tech industry, it also led to significant losses in 2022 as worldwide GPU shipments fell 42%.
Despite the challenging year, Nvidia has proved its resilience in 2023 by pivoting its business toward a burgeoning market: artificial intelligence (AI). The move has pumped its stock up 55% year to date, as AI is increasingly likely to be a significant focus of future technology.
According to Grand View Research, the AI market was worth $136.55 billion in 2022 and will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% through 2030. Considering Nvidia's GPUs have the power to run and develop AI software, the company could have a fruitful future in the quickly growing market.
Moreover, Nvidia's recent partnership with Microsoft's Azure to build a massive cloud AI computer is only more promising for its outlook. Microsoft invested $1 billion in AI start-up OpenAI in 2019, which stunned the tech world last November with the launch of ChatGPT -- a chatbot that can create human-like prose based on prompts. The impressive software has led to reports that Microsoft is considering investing a further $10 billion in the start-up.
As one of the best growth stocks out there, Nvidia shares have risen 283% in the last five years and over 7,000% in the last 10. With its powerful GPUs in hand and a collaboration with one of the biggest names in AI, Nvidia likely has a lucrative future over the long term.
Apple could see new catalyst in rumored AR/VR headset
Like Nvidia, Apple's stock suffered from a burdened tech market in 2022, with its shares falling almost 27% throughout the year. However, reports that the company's biggest product release of 2023 will see it venture into virtual/augmented reality with a new headset have boosted its stock by 21% year to date.
While Apple is already home to a solid business through its current lineup of products and services, the new headset will allow the company to take advantage of a technology of the future. Worth $25.33 billion in 2021, the AR market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 40.9% through 2030 (per Grand View Research). Meanwhile, VR will see a CAGR of 15% in the same period.
In the past, mixed reality devices have predominantly been geared toward gamers. However, experts see the technology easily applied to fields such as healthcare, education, and more in the future. With Apple's past success in entering new markets and quickly rising to dominance, an investment in the tech giant could be an investment in a future leader of the industry.
Apple shares have increased 288% over the last five years and 825% in the last decade, solidifying it as one of the most reliable growth stocks on the market. While both Nvidia and Apple likely have a long future of growth ahead, Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the chart below shows its stock currently offers more value.
Additionally, Apple's forward P/E over the last year has remained far more steady than Nvidia's, which has seen steeper peaks and valleys. As a result, Apple is the more consistent and reliable stock, making it the better growth stock to invest in this month

"ChatGPT seconds Warren Buffett's and Michael Burry's tips on what it takes to be a good investor - the bot lists patience and discipline among 6 must-have traits
2023-02-04T10:00:00Z
• The buzzy AI bot chucked out 6 virtues that lead to investor success, including patience and discipline.
• Its advice mirrored that of top investors like Warren Buffett, but failed to identify other key traits vital to investor success.
ChatGPT, the new buzzy chatbot developed by artificial intelligence company OpenAI, is the world's latest obsession for its human-like responses.
The bot, which bagged a $10 billion investment from Microsoft, has shown a capacity for a range of tasks such as writing stock stories, layoff emails, and even dating-app messages. The craze around it has even boosted investor appetite for AI stocks, sending shares in names like Nvidia and Ambarella soaring.
Earlier this week, I put the human mimic-like tool to the test to see what all the fuss was about. I enjoyed its conversational tone and was grabbed by the ease at which it churned out content, but its lack of empathy or decision-making skills ultimately made it easy for me to remember it's just a robot.
As a frequent writer on the US equities market, I sought out to ask the AI tool what character traits make for a good stock investor. Here's what it chucked at me.
ChatGPT's 6-part tip on traits that make for a successful stock investor
• Patience: Investing in the stock market often requires a long-term perspective and the ability to withstand short-term volatility.
• Discipline: Developing and sticking to a well-thought-out investment strategy can help investors avoid impulsive decisions based on emotions.
• Objectivity: Being able to separate personal opinions and emotions from investment decisions can lead to more rational and informed investment choices.
• Perseverance: Investing in the stock market can be a challenging and sometimes frustrating experience, but having the determination to stay the course and stick to a strategy can lead to long-term success.
• Open-mindedness: Keeping an open mind to new information and being willing to adjust your investment strategy in light of new developments can help you stay ahead of the curve.
• Attention to detail: Careful research and attention to detail can help investors identify the best investment opportunities and avoid costly mistakes.
ChatGPT then cautioned none of its advice can guarantee success. ""Having these traits does not guarantee success in the stock market, but they can help investors make better decisions and navigate the ups and downs of the market more effectively,"" it said.
The bot's tips impressed me, given it mirrored the advice of top investors like Warren Buffet and ""Big Short"" fund manager Michael Burry. Like ChatGPT, Buffett says self-discipline and keeping emotions in check is key for investors.
The Berkshire Hathaway CEO – often considered a role model in the investing world – has also showcased the virtues highlighted by ChatGPT, according to the ""Richer, Wiser, Happier"" author William Green. Green noted that Buffett's phenomenal success was steeped in qualities like patience and having an open mind.
He gave the example of Buffett, who for decades brushed off technology as outside of his circle of competence, then injected $36 billion into Apple between 2016 and 2018. Its stake has blown up in value to about $134 billion today.
Meanwhile, Gabriel Colominas, a buy-side equity analyst at Gesiuris Asset Management and a Burry expert, has said the investor showcased virtues like perseverance through his ability to withstand pressure and possess the deep conviction needed to stay the course.
He used the example of Burry's iconic bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble, which was mocked by Wall Street, only for the legendary investor to be proven right.
However, chatGPT didn't have all the answers. For instance, the bot failed to identify other key traits underpinning Buffett's success like dedication, humility and simplicity.
David Shayer, CEO of Vantage Markets UK, told Insider that while ChatGPT picks up on specific personality traits of successful investors, it misses others.

"3 Nvidia Stock Predictions for 2023
2023-01-12T11:47:00Z
Date Published: 2023-01-12T11:47:00Z
Content:

For years, it seemed Nvidia (NVDA -4.80%) was unstoppable. In fact, in the decade leading up to November 2021, the company grew its revenue by 645%, which in turn drove its stock up more than 8,000%. Then came the economic storm of supply chain disruptions, high inflation, rising interest rates, and the bear market. As a result, Nvidia shares experienced their worst decline in more than 10 years, plunging 53% from their peak.

Yet based on the available evidence, there are great things to come for the semiconductor specialist. Here are three predictions about what to expect from Nvidia in 2023.

It's been a tough couple of quarters for Nvidia shareholders and fair-weather investors have been heading for the exits. During the fiscal 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 30), revenue of $5.9 billion declined 17% year over year, while earnings per share (EPS) of $0.27 plunged 72%.

The culprit? Macroeconomic headwinds have been riding roughshod over consumers. People dealing with decades-high inflation and rising interest rates have become increasingly unsure about what the future holds and are cutting back on spending. Gamers haven't been immune, with many opting to hang on to their high-end Nvidia chips for just a while longer, at least until the economic outlook improves.

History suggests this will result in pent-up demand. As soon as the economy feels a bit more stable, spending on Nvidia processors should kick into high gear, with gamers opting for the latest and greatest the company has to offer.

Nvidia turned heads last week when it announced a strategic partnership with Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry, better known as Foxconn. The company is the world's largest technology manufacturer, best known for assembling Apple's iPhones and other devices. Foxconn and Nvidia will collaborate on highly automated and (eventually) self-driving cars. Foxconn will be the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of electronic control units based on Nvidia's Drive Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC), while also incorporating Nvidia's technology into its own upcoming line of electric vehicles (EVs).

The news came just weeks after Nvidia announced a multiyear collaboration with tech titan Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to build one of the world's most powerful artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers. The project will feature Nvidia processors, networking, and software combined with Microsoft's Azure Cloud.

These announcements illustrate Nvidia's reputation as the partner to the stars, so expect more high-profile partnerships in the year to come.

The data center segment continues to drive the train

Even as Nvidia's gaming segment has taken on water during the past couple of quarters, the data center business continues to grow at a pace that belies the troubled economy. In the third quarter, data center revenue of $3.83 billion climbed 31% year over year, even as the gaming unit slumped.

The ongoing digital transformation continues to chug along -- even in the midst of economic uncertainty -- driven by the increasing adoption of cloud computing. Nvidia is the go-to and top choice for the biggest names in the cloud. Microsoft's Azure Cloud, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Amazon's AWS all rely on Nvidia GPUs to speed their data around the ether -- as do a host of other top cloud operators.

This suggests Nvidia's data center business will remain the company's principal breadwinner, even after the gaming segment recovers.

Nvidia has had a tough time this year, but a look back suggests its trouble will be fleeting.

During the 2022 fiscal fourth quarter (ended Jan. 30, 2022), Nvidia reported record quarterly revenue that grew 53% to $7.6 billion. This was the crown jewel of the company's record-setting year, as revenue of $26.9 billion soared 61%.

What drove these stunning overall results? Record quarterly and fiscal-year revenue in each of Nvidia's largest segments: gaming, data center, and professional visualization. Profits were even more impressive, with record EPS of $1.18, which skyrocketed 103%. This illustrates just how robust Nvidia's business was -- before the economic headwinds came to bear. This suggests that when things begin to improve -- as they no doubt will -- Nvidia's recovery will be both swift and strong.

"Will Nvidia Stock Recover in 2023?
2023-01-12T10:15:00Z
Nvidia (NVDA -4.80%) had a rough outing in 2022. The graphics chip specialist experienced slowing demand as uncertainty about the economy increased during the year, which sent the stock price down 41%.
However, as the world continues to invest in artificial intelligence and advanced computing applications, Nvidia is not done growing by a long shot. Management sees a $400 billion addressable market in selling chips to data centers and gaming enthusiasts.
For the stock to rebound in the near term, investors will be looking for more stable revenue performance. There are a few reasons to be optimistic about a turnaround.
Why the worst might be over
Nvidia reported a 17% year-over-year drop in revenue in the fiscal third quarter, with gaming revenue, the company's second-largest revenue source, falling 51% year over year. Nvidia was caught with too much inventory as demand weakened. This contributed to a 72% year-over-year decline in earnings per share.
HSBC analyst Frank Lee said he believes it will take a few more quarters for Nvidia to work through the excess inventory, which is longer than the market expects. Since hitting a 52-week low of $108 a share in October, the stock rallied to $160 on the expectation that Nvidia is currently navigating through the worst of the situation.
Those expectations are based on management's comments during the last earnings report. Within the gaming segment, CFO Colette Kress said, ""We believe channel inventories are on track to approach normal levels as we exit [the fiscal fourth quarter]."" Kress noted ""tremendous demand"" for the new GeForce RTX 4090 graphics processor for gaming that launched in October.
Management is giving investors a hint of what to expect in 2023. Those who follow Nvidia might remember a similar inventory problem pressuring financial results in calendar 2019. In the fourth-quarter earnings report in February of that year, the company reported a 24% decline in total revenue. But during the conference call with analysts, management said the inventory correction was behind them and believed the business had bottomed.
Sure enough, Nvidia's revenue began to recover the next quarter. The stock hit a 52-week low at the end of 2018 and rose 76% in 2019.
While the circumstances are different this time around with respect to the economy, Nvidia has been shipping fewer gaming chips than the demand in the marketplace to bring down inventory levels in retail channels. This means even with a weak economy, Nvidia should see revenue and profitability start to recover once inventory levels are better matched with demand.
As for Nvidia's data center business, it wasn't a good sign to see revenue growth slowing toward the end of 2022, but there are encouraging signs that Nvidia can keep its largest segment growing in 2023.
Some of Nvidia's largest customers, including Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Microsoft, are still investing heavily in data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. As the leading provider of GPU chips that are used for accelerated computing, such as AI, this is good news for Nvidia.
The data center accelerator market is expected to grow 25% per year to reach $64 billion by 2027, according to Markets and Markets. Next quarter's results will include early shipments of Nvidia's new H100 data center chip, which is expected to see strong demand as customers upgrade their hardware.
Nvidia might be in a slump right now, but the long-term growth trajectory for advanced chips is in investors' favor. For the fiscal fourth quarter, management's guidance calls for modest sequential growth in gaming, data center, and automotive, which could signal the beginning of a turnaround.
I believe Nvidia is likely moving through the worst of its slump, and the stock could finish 2023 higher than it started."
"Better Buy: Nvidia vs. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock
2023-01-17T13:45:00Z
Semiconductor companies are cyclical and heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors. Massive research and development costs, upfront expenses to expand manufacturing capacity, and the constant push for innovation make it expensive to stay relevant. But for many companies, the risk is worth the reward because of the rapid growth in chip demand and applications.
Fortune Business Insights estimates that the global semiconductor market will grow at a compound annual rate of 12.2% between 2022 to 2029, more than doubling from $573 billion to nearly 1.4 trillion.
Nvidia (NVDA -4.80%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.36%) are two industry-leading companies at the forefront of the chip industry. But both stocks are down over 40% from their all-time highs due to a downturn in the industry. Here's why each company may be worth a look now.
Howard Smith (Nvidia): There's no doubt that Nvidia stock was given too much of a premium valuation based on the growth investors expected. That helps explain the more-than-50% drop from its highs in late 2021. That became especially clear when revenue growth in its largest segment sharply reversed course in the current fiscal year.
But the promise and potential that drove Nvidia shares to its unsustainable valuation weren't about the gaming segment, which was thriving at the time. And a transition has already begun that will see the data center, automotive, and artificial intelligence (AI) segments driving the company.
While revenue from gaming chips was only half of what it was a year ago, Nvidia's data center business grew 31% year over year in the fiscal 2023 third-quarter period ended Oct. 30, 2022. An investment in Nvidia now is a bet on growing contributions from automotive and AI customers, who have increasing needs in autonomy, robotics, and data analysis.
And though Nvidia's dividend is minuscule compared to that of Taiwan Semi, the company has returned $9.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases over the first nine months of fiscal 2023. That represented just over half of what has been authorized for buybacks through Dec. 2023.
Nvidia and Taiwan Semi may not deserve the same share of a portfolio. A bet on Nvidia carries added risks that industries like autonomous vehicles and AI will mature and thrive. But for those willing to include a speculative investment with a lot of potential long-term upside, Nvidia's share price correction has now provided an opportunity.
Daniel Foelber (Taiwan Semiconductor): Few companies hold a candle to Nvidia when it comes to dazzling growth and glamorous products. But what Taiwan Semi lacks in flare it more than makes up for with a lower valuation, a wider moat, and a higher dividend yield.
Taiwan Semi has a dirt-cheap forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 13.4, a dividend yield of 2.3%, and a 47% operating margin -- beating Nvidia in all three categories.
Nvidia is one of the most innovative companies in the semiconductor industry. But it's a far riskier business model than Taiwan Semi.
Taiwan Semi is the world's largest pure-play chip foundry. You may be surprised to learn that a fabless chip maker like Nvidia doesn't actually make its own chips, much like Apple isn't actually making its iPhones. It relies on suppliers for that step.
Nvidia -- like basically every major player in the game -- relies on Taiwan Semi to make a sizable chunk of its products. So Taiwan Semi isn't really a competitor with Nvidia. In fact, Nivida is one of its main customers.
Instead, Taiwan Semi is competing with other chip foundries. The name of the game is providing services for the changing needs of customers at a low cost and a fast turnaround. Taiwan Semi isn't immune to competition. But no company comes close to its size and efficiency.
In this vein, Taiwan Semi is a far safer bet on the growth of the industry than any other chip maker. With Taiwan Semi, you're investing in the growth of chip production and usage, whereas with Nvidia, you're investing in a company that you think will spearhead technological breakthroughs.

"Nvidia Stock: Bear vs. Bull
2023-02-22T15:00:00Z
However, it might be best to focus on Nvidia's long-term prospects, no matter the case. The company's stock has grown immensely over the last five and 10 years. Meanwhile, a pivot to data centers and AI could see its business soar over the next decade, making now an excellent time to invest in Nvidia's stock."
"Better Growth Stock: Nvidia vs. Apple
2023-02-10T11:15:00Z
Additionally, Apple's forward P/E over the last year has remained far more steady than Nvidia's, which has seen steeper peaks and valleys. As a result, Apple is the more consistent and reliable stock, making it the better growth stock to invest in this month."
"Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Alphabet
2023-02-20T12:10:00Z

In addition to its dominance over search engines, Alphabet's other potent brands, such as Android, YouTube, Waze, Fitbit, and the many services under Google, could also be elevated by AI and boost its position in the high-growth market.

So which is the better AI buy?

Comparing Alphabet's and Nvidia's stocks is tricky, as one is currently a better bargain, while the other has a stronger position in AI. Regarding the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios, Alphabet's 19, compared to Nvidia's 51.7, shows that Alphabet's stock is a better value. However, Nvidia's GPUs and a partnership with Microsoft Azure give it a stronger lead in the AI race.

As a result, Nvidia is currently the better AI stock. However, if you want more bang for your buck and have faith in Alphabet's future in the industry, go with the Google giant."

This suggests the table is set for a stunning recovery for Nvidia once the economy recovers.

There's an old saying, ""You get what you pay for,"" and Nvidia has never been cheap in terms of traditional valuation metrics.

The stock is currently selling for 17 times sales when most experts agree a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is between 1 and 2. That's not to say that Nvidia stock couldn't fall further from here, but calling the bottom is virtually impossible.

Furthermore, given the company's history of above-average growth and robust future prospects, Nvidia stock is worth every penny."

Investors might not be comfortable paying so much for a company that's facing a massive threat in one of its key businesses. And Nvidia's recent results haven't been all that inspiring to warrant such a steep valuation. Had the company been firing on all cylinders and growing rapidly, growth investors may have considered putting their money on Nvidia.

But that isn't the case, and Nvidia will have to substantially accelerate its growth to justify its valuation. That's why investors who have missed its recent rally might want to wait for a better entry point since it is too late to buy this tech stock right now."

It's a strong growth stock, and the company's shifted focus to cloud computing and AI has proven its resilience. Nvidia's unsteady position in GPUs is concerning but will likely improve over time, with data centers and AI being the driving force of its growth, making the company's stock a compelling long-term investment."
"3 Chip Stocks to Consider in 2023
2023-02-23T14:55:00Z

Like its colleagues, Nvidia is not immune to supply chain disruptions and consumer sentiment around inflation. Furthermore, while the crypto market loses some enthusiasm, miners for tokens may not be as eager to upgrade hardware devices like graphic processing units, which can affect Nvidia's top and bottom lines.

Despite these challenges, Silicon Valley venture capitalist and CEO of Altimeter Capital, Brad Gerstner, recently revealed during a CNBC interview that he had acquired a stake in Nvidia stock. The driving factor behind his bullish thesis revolves around the concept of artificial intelligence (AI).

As digital transformation becomes a core focus of companies of all sizes and industries, the AI landscape witnessed a flood of investment over the last couple of years. Perhaps most notable are the heavy investments big tech companies like Microsoft and Alphabet are making in AI. Gerstner believes Nvidia is leading the AI race and could evolve into the nucleus, powering smart applications globally.

Nvidia stock rocketed about 45% year to date as of the time of this writing. Long-term investors should not be deterred by such a short-term jolt in the stock. The company operates in a growing market and is quickly becoming the industry leader. Long-term investors should consider now to be an opportune time to buy the stock."
"5 Stocks That Moved the Market in January
2023-02-06T11:20:00Z

It wasn't all good news last month. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (PFE -1.30%) dropped 15% in January. The stock has been volatile since reaching its pandemic-era peak in late 2021. Investors are skeptical about Pfizer's short-term growth potential, and there are doubts its new candidate pipeline has the potential to stimulate cash flows over a longer time frame. The value stock also wasn't helped by renewed investor risk appetite, which saw capital moving disproportionately toward growth stocks. There just wasn't much to excite investors about the pharmaceutical leader, and it slumped without any clear catalyst to move higher.

Pfizer isn't going away anytime soon. It still has a valuable product portfolio, even if the medium-term growth outlook is uncertain. However, the stock is likely to continue lagging the market as long as the appetite for risk and growth rises."

Make no mistake, Nvidia has incredible potential as it sells the hardware and software needed to build AI systems like ChatGPT. If you're looking for a trade that will be profitable in the next six to 12 months, Nvidia's recent run-up and steep valuation could be highly problematic. But if you're looking for a top stock to bet on the rise of generative AI services over the next five to 10 years, now could still be a good time to buy.

Whether simulating models of ICs, converting designs over to manufacturing, or offering its IP to speed up development and reduce errors, Cadence should thrive as the world becomes more technologically focused. Best yet for investors -- and again, like Nvidia -- Cadence does it all with a stellar ROIC of 26%.

Helping to drive this strong ROIC is the company's strong recurring revenue base, which generally accounts for 85% to 90% of sales. These repeating sales create one thing that the stock market loves: predictability, which may help explain why Cadence trades at 50 times free cash flow (FCF).

This combination of Cadence's importance to the semiconductor industry and its steep valuation makes it a perfect candidate to add to a bear market watch list waiting for lower prices.

Led by its Falcon platform, CrowdStrike's cloud-native cybersecurity operations offer investors the allure of robust network effects. As trillions of data points are fed into CrowdStrike's security cloud, its AI-powered threat detection grows stronger, protecting its customers across all endpoints.

The more customers using the company's cybersecurity platform, the stronger its network grows, creating a virtuous cycle for CrowdStrike, its customers, and investors. Perhaps thanks to this network effect, the company now counts 258 of the Fortune 500 as customers.

While all of the company's operations are available on one agent (specialized software component), it lets customers choose from 23 specific Falcon cloud modules to address their cybersecurity needs. As of its most recent quarter, 60% of CrowdStrike's customers used five or more modules, and 21% deployed seven or more.

Despite posting 700% revenue growth since its initial public offering in 2019, the company is already FCF-positive -- even after subtracting stock-based compensation.

With operations so essential to corporations' safety, CrowdStrike won't be a value stock soon. However, its incredible growth, burgeoning network effects, and steady cash generation so early in its company lifecycle make it an excellent business to consider on the next dip."

The increased spending is already showing signs of the effect it will have more broadly across the company down the road. For example, management previously reported that improved AI recommendations led to a 15% increase in watch time in Facebook Reels in the second quarter of last year.

Improvements to the discovery engine using AI are a big opportunity to drive higher engagement and ad revenue. In the third quarter, there was a 50% increase in the number of played Reels compared to the previous six months. Management believed this represented a market share gain against top competitor TikTok.

These investments are widening the company's competitive moat and setting up the next leg of growth, including the moonshot opportunity the company has in the metaverse and virtual reality. With negative sentiment hovering over the stock, this is an ideal point to start building a position before better news sends the stock higher."
"2 No-Brainer Stocks I'd Buy Right Now Without Hesitation
2023-01-27T10:25:00Z

Beyond 2023, analysts expect Nvidia to grow earnings per share at an annualized rate of 21% over the next five years. That's consistent with Nvidia's previous growth and could deliver equally impressive gains for investors.

Nvidia is one of those stocks you want to look for opportunities to buy over time instead of selling. Companies will continue to adopt advanced chips and software to distill more insights about customer behavior, among other uses for Nvidia's high-powered GPUs. These global trends, along with the company's dominant market share position, make me confident in the stock's return potential."
"1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock You Can Confidently Pay a Premium For and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague
2023-02-22T10:06:00Z

Nvidia is best known for its role in the graphics processing unit (GPU) space. It's responsible for selling close to 20% of global GPUs, and has a veritable stranglehold on the discrete graphics card market, with an 80% share.

Nvidia's GPUs are used by gamers, businesses operating data centers, and cryptocurrency miners. They're also expected to play a key role in the development of a variety of AI products.

In one respect, this means Nvidia will be a key hardware player. Its GPUs will be leaned on for accelerated computing capabilities, which are vital for machine-learning/AI solutions.

It also means Nvidia can become an AI player on its own merit -- i.e., beyond just supplying the necessary hardware. Over the past two years, Nvidia brought a number of AI initiatives to market, including its own virtual digital assistant solutions capable of helping businesses serve their customers by responding to voice commands.

While Nvidia does have a long-term pathway to success in AI, there are a couple of red flags that should keep it off investors' radars for perhaps the next year or few years. For instance, it's going to be awhile before AI is anything more than a marginal revenue driver for Nvidia.

Another reason to be skeptical of Nvidia at a premium valuation is its gaming division. Gaming is incredibly important to Nvidia's profitability. Yet during the fiscal third quarter (note: this write-up is being done prior to Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings release on Feb. 22), Nvidia noted an unsightly 51% decline in year-over-year gaming revenue. As the COVID-19 pandemic gets placed into the rearview mirror and life returns to some semblance of normal, Nvidia's top segment could struggle to regain its luster, with people no longer stuck in their homes.

Nvidia also tends to ebb and flow with the cryptocurrency industry. Since its GPUs are important to mining certain types of tokens, an extended bear market for crypto often removes a high-growth sales channel for Nvidia.

With absolutely no sales growth expected in fiscal 2023 and practically all semiconductor stocks warning about weakening demand/orders for the current calendar year, Nvidia at 50 times forward-year earnings is an easy stock to avoid."
"Don't Go Into the Next Bull Market Without These 3 Stocks
2023-02-10T15:00:00Z

Just keep things in perspective

Again, just because these three stocks performed outrageously well during the previous bull market doesn't mean they'll repeat the feat in the next one; they probably won't. Most major winners are unexpected, often ""coming out of nowhere,"" so to speak. The next bull market isn't apt to be different.

Also know that while it's not too soon to start reorganizing your portfolio for prolonged bullishness, there's no guarantee last year's bear market is over. It's possible we could see new lows before all is said and done.

On the other hand, the biggest risk that investors face isn't suffering a little bit more downside, but instead missing out on the full potential of a new bull market from its onset. A huge piece of a long-term bull run's gain takes shape at the very beginning of a bull market.

Either way, all three of these stocks are meant to be long-term positions based on their previous results and their underlying company's future growth prospects. It doesn't -- or shouldn't, anyway -- entirely matter if you step in at the exact bear market low. The only exception to this line of thinking might be United Rentals, only because it has ignored marketwide bearishness and has soared since October."

Also, Nvidia is forecast to clock 31% earnings growth in the current fiscal year to $4.29 per share and maintain that momentum over a five-year period as well, with an annual earnings growth rate of 21%. So, it would be prudent for existing Nvidia shareholders to continue holding the stock because it looks capable of delivering more upside. What's more, they may even consider adding to their positions if the stock dips in the near term on account of the weakness in the gaming business, as the growth drivers it is sitting on should lead to long-term gains."

"3 Red-Hot Stocks That Could Continue to Beat the Market
2023-02-09T11:05:00Z

If you're not familiar, SolarEdge makes power inverters for solar panels. The solar panels collect the sun's electricity-producing photons, and inverters like the ones made by SolarEdge convert them into the usable AC electricity being piped to your home's light fixtures and wall sockets. As it turns out, while they're generally efficient enough, poorly conceived inverters have been as big of hurdle to mainstreaming solar power as relatively inefficient panels were at one point. Not only can SolarEdge's inverters be easily managed with an app, but they also integrate nicely with solar's common add-ons like EV chargers and battery-based power storage.

There's never been a better time to be in the business, either. New legislation turned into federal law in the middle of last year boosts the industry in a big way. Namely, the Defense Production Act encourages more domestic production of solar panels, while the Inflation Reduction Act offers generous tax credits for all facets of new solar power system installations. Much of the rest of the world is taking similar stimulative measures as well.

These tailwinds are expected to make a major impact, too. The International Energy Agency indicates the planet's annual pace of solar panel installations will quadruple between 2022 and 2030. This market growth is a key reason SolarEdge Technologies' top line is expected to have grown by nearly 60% last year, and will likely rise another 30% this year."
"3 Surprising Stocks You Never Knew Warren Buffett Owns
2023-01-30T10:06:00Z

Nevertheless, gold is revered as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, which is what's made it such a popular holding for much of the past year. Newmont is the world's largest gold producer, with annual production expected to average around 8 million gold equivalent ounces through 2031. The company is also sitting on 96 million ounces of gold reserves and countless projects that should take its production well into the 2040s.

Given that gold stocks historically perform their best during the very early stages of a new bull market, we're getting close to the sweet spot for Newmont and its mining peers.

The third surprising stock you'd never have guessed Warren Buffett owns is graphics card and semiconductor solutions specialist Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%). New England Asset Management's third-quarter 13F showed it held 3,050 shares of Nvidia.

The reason this is a such a shock is simple: Warren Buffett generally avoids tech stocks. With the exception of Apple, pretty much every other tech-oriented company in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio has been added by one of Buffett's investing lieutenants (Todd Combs and Weschler). The Oracle of Omaha has never had the time nor drive to keep up on the changing tech landscape, and has preferred devoting most of his energy and research to the financial and consumer staples sectors.

On the bright side, Nvidia is a beast in the graphics processing unit (GPU) arena. It accounts for close to 20% of the global GPU market and an astounding 80% of global discrete graphic cards. The latter being GPUs that are separate from the processor. Maintaining such a large role in the GPU space has allowed Nvidia to become a major player in the gaming industry.

But things are far from perfect for one of the United States' largest publicly traded companies. For instance, U.S. regulators barred Nvidia from shipping its artificial intelligence-driven A100 GPUs to China for security reasons in early September. Even though Nvidia developed a slower GPU for China, the end result could be a significant reduction in expected sales.

We're also seeing macroeconomic weakness in key markets for Nvidia. A bear market in cryptocurrencies has limited the purchase of mining solutions, while COVID-19 vaccine uptake has caused gaming GPU demand to fall off a cliff. Gaming revenue fell 51% from the prior-year period in the fiscal third quarter.

Long story short, I wouldn't expect Buffett to be championing Nvidia as a buy for Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio anytime soon."
"A Bull Market Is Coming: 5 Killer Growth Stocks I Just Bought
2023-02-12T11:55:00Z

As the economy slowed, The Trade Desk's stock tanked, falling as much as 64% from its peak. Yet that decline belies the business strength that continues to shine, even in dark times.

It's well-documented that marketers rein in ad spending during periods of economic uncertainty, yet The Trade Desk continues to prosper. In Q3, The Trade Desk's revenue grew 31% year over year, stealing market share from its well-established rivals as marketers look for a better return on their advertising dollars. What's more, The Trade Desk's profits continue to roll in.

Investors (myself included) are increasingly optimistic that The Trade Desk will endure and thrive, sending its stock price up more than 26% since early November.

Organizing data into rows and columns was revolutionary when it debuted, but databases have continued evolving. MongoDB (MDB -3.54%) leads the way with an innovative, multi-cloud, database-as-a-service solution. This next-generation system stores data from messy, more modern sources, including social media posts, photos, emails, audio and video clips, and even entire documents. Since its public debut in late 2017, this elegant solution helped drive revenue up 930%, fueling a stock rise of 589%. But that could be just the beginning.

Investors worried that ongoing economic turmoil would hit the company hard. The ensuing exodus sent the stock tumbling as much as 76%. Yet MongoDB continued growing, even as its stock price sank.

In Q3, revenue grew 47%, while its flagship Atlas database grew 61%. At the same time, MongoDB swung to an adjusted profit, catching Wall Street by surprise, as analysts had expected a loss. Robust customer growth helped drive the results. Total customers grew 26% year over year to 39,100, while those spending $100,000 or more annually grew 29%.

The company's continuing strength in the face of adversity has buoyed confidence, lifting the stock more than 55% from its recent lows. Given its history of strong performance, there's likely more where that came from.

Tesla (TSLA -2.57%) turned the auto industry on its head by proving there was a market for electric vehicles (EVs) that were stylish and fun to drive. Over the past decade, Tesla's revenue grew 4,230%, fueling the stock's 8,000% rise.

Revolutionizing an industry looks great on paper, but that didn't stop the stock from shedding as much as 73% of its value, driven lower by slowing sales and light production and delivery numbers.

It's important to put those shortfalls in context. Even as Tesla missed its own goal of generating 50% year-over-year growth, it still managed to deliver a record 405,278 cars in the fourth quarter and 40% year-over-year growth, even in the face of economic headwinds. Still, if Tesla can achieve those results in the midst of a struggling economy, imagine how much more it can do when the economy is less uncertain. Tesla is already off to the races, with the stock up 92% since late last year.

You get what you pay for

I said at the outset that stocks with high valuations suffered over the past several years, and these five companies certainly qualify in that regard. In fact, some investors might continue to balk at the price tags of these stocks. They're currently selling at 5 to 15 times next year's sales when most experts agree a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is between 1 and 2.

However, valuation shouldn't be considered in a vacuum, but viewed in the context of each company's historical performance and ongoing growth prospects.

Each of these companies boasts an enviable history of above-average growth, which makes these disruptors worth every penny in my book. That's why I added to my position in every one of these stocks this month and have continued to buy through the downturn

However, the stock's rapidly soaring valuation is one of the biggest reasons investors may be hesitant about buying Nvidia stock today. There are also concerns that demand for computers is slowing down, which also means less need for the company's graphics cards.

There are headwinds that could send Nvidia's shares down, and its 90 times earnings multiple certainly doesn't help. But if you're willing to hang on, this could still be a good buy in the long term.

2023-02-13T10:06:00Z

When most people think of IBM, they're liable to envision a slow-growing, moneymaking blue-chip with a top-notch dividend. IBM was a bit slow to transition to a cloud-driven future, and has used acquisitions as a way to close the gap for its tardiness. Though it's remained quite profitable, its legacy operations were a drag for years.

However, IBM's ongoing transformation relies on two high-growth opportunities. First, it's attempting to establish itself as a clear leader in hybrid-cloud solutions. With more people than ever choosing to work remotely, there's a growing need for public and private cloud security, as well as a way for public and private clouds to interact with each other. IBM is making that happen and taking advantage of a well-defined shift in the labor market.

The other key growth driver for IBM is AI. Although supercomputer Watson is perhaps the best example of IBM's AI and analytics in action, it's far from the most practical. Instead, IBM offers an abundance of services incorporating AI and machine-learning technology. This includes relying on AI to converse with customers online; allowing AI to make large data more easily understandable to streamline operations, and even using AI to help businesses maintain regulatory governance standards in a world with ever-changing laws.

The third artificial intelligence stock held in Warren Buffett's secret portfolio is semiconductor specialist Nvidia (NVDA -1.60%). New England Asset Management's stake totaled 3,050 shares at the end of the third quarter.

Nvidia is best-known for its role as a graphics processing unit (GPU) giant. The company's GPUs are used by gaming enthusiasts, businesses operating large data centers, and even cryptocurrency miners. Nvidia accounts for nearly a fifth of global GPU sales, and holds the lion's share (80%) of the discrete graphics card market.

The most direct impact Nvidia is having within AI has to do with its GPUs. Since AI is reliant on high-powered computing, the company's GPUs are a necessary tool that facilitates machine-learning and split-second decision-making.

But Nvidia's AI opportunity involves more than just taking advantage of businesses need for high-powered GPUs. Last year, the company introduced a number of AI platform initiatives, including its conversational AI platform and AI Enterprise platform. These solutions provide tools that let businesses deploy virtual agents or chatbots, as well as oversee the development and deployment of AI innovations.

While AI is unlikely to be a significant revenue driver for Nvidia anytime soon, the company's actions make clear that AI is a big part of its future."

The stock's forward P/E is 35, which is a bit high for most growth investors, and its 0.7% dividend ratio is unlikely to excite anyone. That's why this is a hybrid sort of investment that might not be the first choice for either the growth or value crowd. Nonetheless, Costco is a remarkably stable business with above-average growth prospects that can be a straightforward addition to balance out any portfolio."
"Warren Buffett's 5 Top AI Stocks -- Here's Why You Should Own Them, Too
2023-02-23T10:50:00Z

Why you should own them, too

I think there's one overriding reason why you should consider owning all five of the top AI stocks in Buffett's portfolio. It's the same reason why Buffett himself buys and holds stocks: Their growth prospects make their current valuations attractive.

To be sure, some of these stocks look more attractively valued than others. Alphabet, for example, trades at a much lower forward earnings multiple than Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, or Nvidia do. However, my view is that even the most expensive of these stocks will prove to be a huge winner over the long run.

These aren't just AI stocks, of course. All of these companies have other growth drivers in addition to AI. But AI will no doubt be extremely important to their fortunes over the next decade and beyond. I think that Buffett's top five AI stocks will make him even wealthier in the future. They could make you richer, too."

While all memory suppliers would benefit in that scenario, Micron has impressed on the technology side, as it became the first memory maker to mass produce 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND in 2022. As long as Micron keeps up its technological lead and targets the AI market, it should have a much better second half of 2023 and 2024.

When Mr. Market gives you lemons, bring some sugar

Anders Bylund (Lemonade): Let's talk about Lemonade, an insurance technology company powered by artificial intelligence and highly automated processes.

By automating much of the traditional insurance process using AI, Lemonade is able to offer affordable insurance policies to its customers. Its homegrown AI technology is similar to the language model GPT, which runs the popular ChatGPT service. Like ChatGPT, Lemonade's AI system uses natural language processing to make sense of a large amount of potentially disorganized data. The sign-up process is managed by AI-driven chatbots and insurance claims are run through the same chatbot, triggering a specialized module that specializes in analyzing risks, damage, repair costs, and so on.

The company likes to shine a spotlight on its cool AI tools. In last November's investor day presentation, for example, Lemonade's custom chatbot provided a Shakespearean sonnet about AI and insurance, followed by a computer-generated schematic of an AI-driven insurance system:

The inner workings of Lemonade's AI-powered analytics and customer service systems are proprietary and unknown. Still, the company clearly makes at least some use of OpenAI's GPT (language-based modeling) and DALL-E (image generation) services -- tweaked to serve its specific insurance service needs.

The more customers Lemonade earns, the more real-world data it gets to train its systems on. As a result, its underwriting and risk management policies should become more accurate and profitable over time. So when people panic over Lemonade's less-than-perfect loss ratios and negative profits, they're treating temporary issues like permanent business flaws.

This innovative insurance disruptor has seen share prices fall more than 90% in two years while it expanded its coverage offerings both geographically and into new insurance types, with a fully nationwide push into the lucrative car insurance market still ahead. The top-line revenue is not just skyrocketing, but accelerating over time:

Yes, the company is burning some cash in an effort to maximize its market share before a torrent of imitators come along. That's a smart long-term growth strategy in my eyes, as long as you can accept lumpy and often unprofitable financial reports along the way.

When the next bull market comes along, it'll throw gasoline on Lemonade's growth fires as consumers start buying cars and homes again. On top of that catalyst, Lemonade has captured less than about 0.01% (not a typo!) of the American insurance market so far.

Cybersecurity that's ready for the AI era

Nicholas Rossolillo (Palo Alto Networks): Palo Alto Networks is the largest cybersecurity pure-play stock out there, with $5.8 billion in revenue over the last reported 12-month stretch. (Microsoft said it did $20 billion in cybersecurity sales in 2022, so it's far and away the security software leader.) Cybersecurity is a tricky industry. It requires constant innovation and necessitates playing non-stop offense to stay ahead of digital threats. Under the guidance of CEO Nikesh Arora, Palo Alto Networks has transformed itself into a technological powerhouse ready to tackle the complexities of the AI era.

During its last quarterly update, Palo Alto Networks said its ""next-gen"" security platform (designed for modern cloud-based IT and other advanced computing) was generating $2.1 billion on an annualized basis. With an advanced suite of services that cover all bases of a large organizations' operations, Palo Alto Networks is well positioned to capture new business in the years ahead as more of its customers migrate to the cloud and adopt AI-powered applications.

"3 Top Stocks to Profit From the Coming AI Explosion

Then there's Marvell Technology Group (MRVL -3.09%), which also made a few acquisitions in recent years to boost its network connectivity chip lineup. New processors and accelerators are needed to process AI workloads. But next-gen infrastructure that carries massive amounts of data within the cloud and then delivers the final product to the user is also a key part of modern AI-powered applications.

Marvell is a leader in this high-throughput networking space. As companies like Meta design their data centers around new AI, Marvell will most certainly be an ingredient in their recipes. Shares trade for just under 16 times one-year forward expected earnings.

During the last earnings call, Zuckerberg highlighted Meta's new focus on ""delivering compounding earnings growth even while investing aggressively in future technology."" It's great news for investors that big tech is shifting its focus to profitable growth, but semiconductor companies have already been focused on this all along. As the AI battle brews among Meta, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others, chip stocks could be the best way to profit in the years to come."

Every sensor on these machines is connected [00:04:00] to a mobile application. This is a representation of what a farmer will be seen on their phone. At any point, a farmer can basically from anywhere in the world monitor what's going on with any of their vehicles. They can click on any one of those vehicles. They can monitor the data that's coming from any of those sensors. In some cases, they can reconfigure the machine remotely from the mobile app. If you asked 10 farmers today, what's the coolest piece of technology and agriculture? I bet at least half of them would tell you it's the mobile app. Because the mobile app brings it all together.

Julian Sanchez: Let's go over here. Let's talk about autonomy then. Last year at CES, we announced our first full autonomous tractor. This is a sensor suite for the autonomous tractor. This sensor suite will go in the front of the tractor, and it has three pairs of stereo cameras. There's actually another [00:05:00] set of stereo cameras in the back, so we get a 360 view. But basically, we've introduced autonomy in one of the applications in agriculture, which is Tillage. Over the next decade we plan to extend autonomy to the other applications in agriculture which is spraying, harvesting the crops and planting the crops. Just about every farmer you talk to globally, one of the top three asks that come up is autonomy. Because labor shortages are an issue. By the way, labor shortages in agriculture were an issue before they were labor shortages everywhere else."
"Is Texas Instruments Stock a Better Buy Than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing?
2023-02-07T11:11:00Z

TSMC doesn't have this problem. The only chips it manufactures are those of its chip design partners, freeing it up to focus on customer service. And that's how it has built itself into the undisputed market share leader in advanced chip manufacturing (over half of the global advanced chip fabrication market belongs to TSMC).

Why TI could be the better stock

As great as these top two semiconductor stocks are, though, TI's long-term performance has been untouchable in the chip manufacturing space. Since 2004 (when current but soon retiring TI CEO Rich Templeton took over, and long before TSMC was a powerhouse manufacturer), TI's profit margin has soared, leading to free-cash-flow-per-share growth that is double that of TSMC. If you're looking for a shareholder-friendly company (one that pays a rising dividend and uses any leftover free cash flow to repurchase stock), Texas Instruments is an elite company very few businesses can rival.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is an absolutely wonderful company, and shareholders will likely be very happy owning it, too. But Texas Instruments could be the better investment for investors looking for a buy-it-and-forget-it stock to hold for the long term."
"Better Buy: AMD vs. Intel
2023-02-23T14:05:42Z

Another reason to be hopeful about Intel this year is the launch of the company's Sapphire Rapids server processors. Originally slated for release in April 2021, the Sapphire Rapids processors have finally hit the market this year after four delays. The good part is that these processors seem to be gaining popularity already.

Nvidia, for instance, will develop systems using the Sapphire Rapids processors, while Cisco has also tapped Intel's latest offering for its server systems. As a result, there is a possibility of Intel being able to ward off AMD's growing dominance in the server market this year, and that could play an important role in helping the company deliver better-than-expected results.

We have already seen that Intel's revenue and earnings are expected to decline substantially in 2023. AMD's revenue, on the other hand, is expected to remain flat, while adjusted earnings could decline 13% to $3.05 per share.

Given that AMD is trading at just 26 times forward earnings as compared to Intel's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 54, the former looks like a better tech stock for investors to buy right now, given the healthier state of its business and the market share gains that it is clocking."
"Thinking of Buying Chip Stocks? Avoid This One at All Costs
2023-02-01T15:10:00Z

Intel aims to cut annual costs by $8 billion to $10 billion by 2025 as it prepares to invest as much as $120 billion on two new fabrication foundries in the U.S. But bridging the cash gap could be difficult because those plants won't come online for years, and they represent considerable risk. The company spent $6 billion on dividends last year, and if the chip market continues to weaken, its 5.2% yield could be at risk as well. If it is forced to cut or suspend its dividend, the stock will only dive further into a tailspin.

At this point, Intel is getting slammed by market headwinds and has a long track record of poor investment decisions and value destruction. It has fallen behind competitors and is burning billions in cash. If you're looking to invest in the semiconductor sector, don't be fooled by Intel's seemingly cheap valuation. There are many better options in the industry."

"Beth Kindig on AI, Semiconductors, and Tech Cycles
2023-02-18T15:09:00Z

The deceleration from Q3 to Q4 last year. I don't think cloud has ever seen that deceleration, not that I can recall. It was nearly a 70 percent deceleration. There should be typically in 2021, 17 percent growth between Q3 and Q4 because it's like a budget flush. You hurry up and use the rest of your budget. There is sequential growth on average across best-of-breed is now five percent, so from 17 to 5 were not negative yet, but that's a substantial deceleration. If we have one or two more of those, quarter to quarter, cloud would be in bigger trouble. We've taken about a 30 percent allocation down to about a 10 percent. We still participate in cloud and this is across various positions, but we're not overweight cloud until we see what's going to happen. Again, we could have one or two, three, four best-of-breeds beat. This is not about getting lucky, this is about being directionally aligned with the fundamentals of not only a vertical such as cloud, but the companies in our portfolio.

Deidre Woollard: Interesting, so of course we're seeing a lot of layoffs, we're seeing a lot of rightsizing and I believe Mark Zuckerberg for Meta, he called it the year of efficiency. Is that something that you're watching for different companies, how well they're trimming those expenses to match expectations?

Beth Kindig: Yes, another great point about cloud is that it tends to be fairly weak on the bottom line so they would have to cut quite a bit in order to improve the health of their bottom line. That's actually unique from one of the worst performing sectors last year was ad-tech. Ad-tech as a whole tends to be cash efficient, but you can pull some levers. Cloud tends to not be cash-efficient so that's yet another headwind. What levers are going to be pulled? What will it result in? Will it ultimately make a best-of-breed weaker to a company like Microsoft, which has more room to pull levers. I love the quote that Satya Nadella had just said and I'll probably mess it up a little bit, but he basically said there's one law of gravity, which is inflation-adjusted growth, which all companies are subject to.

I think that that quote is like the theme of 2023, which I guess Meta repackaged as efficiency, but what I would say is the more that we're in a higher inflation rising rate and environment combined, the harder it will be for companies to grow, the harder is for companies to grow, the worst their bottom lines will be, the worst their bottom lines will be the harder it will be for them to raise money or continue to operate. It's a snowball effect or domino effect, which I think Satya Nadella really put it nicely about that gravity because we all know gravity effects every human and he's basically saying it'll affect every company and there's not going to be too many outliers. I always think there will be a couple of outliers because I'm optimistic, but he's basically saying it's a law rather than something more subjective.

Deidre Woollard: Interesting. Well, I want to talk a little bit about cycles in general. You just talked about cloud. Let's talk a little bit about semiconductors and what's happening there. One of the things that I'm hearing, I heard this from Taiwan Semi or heard this also in the AMD earnings was like they're almost saying Q4 was great. First-half of 2023, don't think about it's going to be terrible and then we're going to be great the second half of 2023, what are you seeing in this semiconductor cycle, both in the short term and the long term?

Beth Kindig: If we're underweight cloud until we see what these companies are capable of with this reduced spending or lower budgets, I would say we're overweight semis and a lot of it is not only some of the visibility that we're getting across a few different companies. I hope Nvidia echoes what AMD and TSM are saying because the more companies that agree on an H2 rebound, the more confident as investors we can be about it, rather than just one siloed comment from a management team. I liked the fact TSM and AMD both lined up on those comments. Secondly, what I would say is that they have better visibility.

"Texas Instruments: The Semiconductor Stock to Own This Decade

Templeton has been a fantastic CEO for TI, making these big shoes to fill for Ilan. Time will tell if he's up to the task, but executive transitions are never seamless and always present risks for shareholders.

"2 Top Bargain Stocks Ready for a Bull Run

This probably explains why investors aren't worried about the short-term slowdown in TSMC's growth. The company's top and bottom lines are expected to drop in the current quarter as compared to the prior-year period. Consensus estimates suggest that TSMC's revenue would increase only 1% in 2023 to $76.6 billion, while earnings could drop to $5.56 per share from $6.60 per share in 2022.

However, TSMC could spring a positive surprise as the year progresses. That's because the company is forecasting solid demand for chips manufactured on its N3 3-nanometer (nm) process. TSMC has started the volume production of these chips and claims that their demand exceeds supply. The company also points out that the demand for its 3nm chips, which it claims is ""the most advanced semiconductor technology,"" should continue driving growth in the coming years as well.

Global semiconductor industry revenue is also expected to increase 16.3% in 2024 to $654 billion. So, TSMC's growth could start picking up the pace in the second half of the current year, and it should be able to sustain the same in 2024, which explains why analysts are expecting solid growth from the company next year.

In all, TSMC's weakness shouldn't last for long, and the improving conditions in the semiconductor market should be a tailwind for this stock. All this makes TSMC stock a smart buy right now, given its cheap valuation and ability to deliver a healthy upside in 2023 and beyond."

TI's stock should remain stable over the next 12 months, but I expect its elevated valuation (which was buoyed by its reputation as a safe haven stock during the bear market) to limit its near-term gains. Therefore, it could stay flat or rise slightly -- but it could struggle to outperform the S&P 500 again if the bear market finally ends this year."

"3 Things About Texas Instruments That Smart Investors Know

That's an intriguing question, but I personally think Taiwan's ITRI, which also hatched TSMC's rival UMC, could still have created another contract chipmaking giant without Chang at the helm. At the same time, I think TI's board would probably have rejected the idea of turning the company into a pure-play contract chipmaker -- since it would have been cheaper to set up an operation of that scale in Asia.

Is Texas Instruments still an evergreen investment?

TI has gone through several major evolutions throughout its 72-year history, but I believe the current business is poised to grow for decades to come. It's definitely not an exciting growth stock anymore, but its slow but steady returns could still beat the market over the long term as the semiconductor market expands."

If Salesforce can double its revenue to $60 billion in five years, which would be a lower rate of growth than it has achieved historically, it should generate at least $15 billion in adjusted operating profit.

And what of Mobileye, a leader in providing chips for advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) and self-driving car chips? Remember that Intel partially spun out Mobileye in 2022 and sold 5% of its stake to raise some cash. Up to this point, Intel has indicated it could use Mobileye's relisting on stock exchanges to sell shares and raise cash. If I were an Intel shareholder, I would hope this isn't the plan. That would be akin to treating your star racehorse like a dairy cow.

For the time being, Intel says it still owns 94% of Mobileye shares.

There needs to be better news to warrant a buy

With most other semiconductor companies remaining profitable and indicating their businesses will return to growth by the second half of 2023, Intel's current outlook is dismal. Revenue is in sharp retreat and could remain so for the foreseeable future. Moreover, the balance sheet is in just OK shape, with cash and short-term investments of $28 billion, offset by debt of $42 billion.

Until the company can provide some more concrete guidance on its recovery -- and return to profitability because it certainly should at least be that with $11 billion in quarterly revenue expected in Q1 -- this looks like a value trap. There are far better semiconductor stocks to buy now that have a much better risk-to-reward payoff than Intel stock offers. So I'll double down on what I said a few months ago and say it's way too early to bet on an Intel recovery."
"Interview With David Rolfe of Wedgewood Partners
2023-02-17T20:48:00Z

There are five steps that synthesize our philosophy and process, all in accordance with prudent risk management. One: Profitability is the mother's milk of growth. Best-in-class profitability is our process North Star. Better businesses typically perform better in tough times and emerge even stronger after industry downturns or general recessions. Two: We believe the best way to generate wealth is through the long-term ownership of exceptional growth companies, where intrinsic value growth compounds at least at double-digit rates over time. Three: Businesses that require the least amount of capital to maintain their competitive position and support future growth are inherently better businesses. Four: We earnestly believe and practice the maxim, ""Price is what you pay; value is what you get."" We endeavor to invest in a select few, best-of-breed businesses when the stocks of such businesses are either misunderstood by the market and/or undervalued by the market relative to their long-term growth prospects. Five: We build our 20-stock portfolio by overweighting our highest-conviction ideas, all the while adhering to prudent diversification through limited business model overlap.

Rotonti: What is your portfolio management philosophy? How many stocks do you own? How do you determine weightings? What percentage of your portfolio is in cash?

Rolfe: ""Invest like an owner"" may be an overused cliché, but we practice exactly this at Wedgewood. Such a mentality becomes very powerful when so many of our active management peers profess such, but their portfolio turnover stats tell another, much different tale. For example, during calendar 2022, we sold just two stocks and bought just one. We typically own 20. We weight each holding on two scores. First, we weight what we consider our best risk-reward stocks the highest. Second, we also take care to make sure that every stock weighting in our portfolio is weighted higher than its respective constituent weighting in the benchmark. The only exception to No. 2 has been the huge weightings of a few megatech stocks. Our cash weighting is typically around 2%-4%. We aren't market timers. We want to own great businesses, not hold cash.

Rotonti: How do you think about risk management and portfolio diversity?

Rolfe: We think of risk management within the confines a 20-stock portfolio. Competitively advantaged businesses are best suited to ward off competitors throughout both industry cycles and economic cycles. Buying expensive stocks is a recipe for sustained underperformance -- no matter how great the underlying business may be. Again, price is what you pay; value is what you get. We are the antithesis of momentum investing, which is a staple in large-cap growth investing. Diversifying by business model, rather than industry sectors, is key to investing in just 20 stocks. While we are extremely focused relative to our benchmark and most active managers, that said, we won't let any position exceed 10% of the portfolio. Lastly, being an independent firm protects our unique investment strategy from the performance ruination of institutional imperatives, which so many other active managers suffer.

On the matter of portfolio diversity, we believe ""business model"" diversity trumps the more common ""Noah's Ark"" model of diversity whereby most portfolio managers buy a couple of stocks in too many industries to ""diversify."" Here's how we think about business model diversity -- consider our technology holdings. Motorola Solutions (MSI -0.83%) couldn't be a more different business model than, say, Microsoft (MSFT -2.18%), while Microsoft's business model couldn't be more different than Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM -2.19%). Business model diversification has been a staple of our risk management since our strategy's inception.

As a proof statement of our portfolio risk management, again in the context of a portfolio of just 20 stocks, consider that since our strategy's inception 1992, there have been 28 3-year rolling time periods. We have generated positive returns in 26 of those periods, or 93%. There have been 26 5-year rolling periods. We have generated positive returns in 25 of those periods, or 96%. Both percentages greater than broad stock market indexes.

"Tesla (TSLA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-01-26T05:30:27Z

And we've got an amazing plan for making the 4680 cell low cost and high energy density. So energy storage also saw record growth, and that is continuing to accelerate. That's always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric vehicles, solar and wind, and the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind, because obviously, the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. So you have those three things.

You can convert all of earth to a fully sustainable situation many times over, actually. So I would like to just make it clear that there is a path to a fully sustainable future for humanity, and we -- our goal at Tesla is to accelerate progress on that path as much as humanly possible. So yes, so we were ramping up Megapack production. And we expect it to grow at a rate quite a bit faster than our legal output.

So in conclusion, we are taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can. We believe we can keep pushing for strong volume growth while retaining the industry's best operating margins. As we mentioned many times before, we want to be the best manufacturer. But really, manufacturing technology will be our most important long-term strength.

And we'll talk more about our upcoming plans at the March 1 investor day. And lastly, I want to once again thank all of our employees for delivering another record-breaking year. Congratulations, guys.

Thanks, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.

Yes. Thanks, Martin. So as Elon mentioned, 2022 was a terrific year for Tesla. I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a volatile year.

On a full year basis, revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading. Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP opex as a percentage of revenue improved further. For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions as we are managing through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S. and a rising interest rate environment.

Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%. Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors: first is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls; second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories; third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily toward Model Y, which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3. Partially offsetting these impacts, we've continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with the progress we've made in prior years.

These improvements include our continued work to gradually move toward a regionally balanced build of vehicles. The energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and commercial storage. While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory. As we look toward 2023, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.

There are three key points I wanted to make here. First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high. Second, on cost reduction, we're holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume while improving overhead efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins. In particular, we're accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-house cells, where inefficiencies are the highest.

But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability. This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as an example. As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our suppliers on this journey as well. In that, we've priced our products with a view toward a longer-term cost structure.

"Intel (INTC) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-01-27T02:00:22Z

In the server market, the overall consumption TAM grew modestly in calendar year '22, albeit at diminishing rates as the year progressed. Inventory burn drove server CPU shipments down mid-single digits year on year in calendar year '22 with hyperscale up, offset by declines in enterprise and Rest of World. Our share in calendar year '22 was in line with our subdued expectations, and our revenue volatility was a function of TAM, especially given our outsized exposure to enterprise and China. We expect Q1 server consumption TAM to decline both sequentially and year over year at an accelerated rate with first half '23 server consumption TAM down year on year before returning to growth in the second half.

While all segments have weakened, enterprise and rest of world, especially China, continues to be weaker than hyperscale. However, we'd highlight that the correction in enterprise and rest of the world, where we have stronger positions are further along than hyperscale. Lastly, in our broad-based markets like industrial, auto and infrastructure, demand trends throughout calendar year '22 were strong but not completely immune to the macro volatility. Strong demand in these markets was mirrored by strong Q4 and record calendar year '22 revenue in NEX, PSG, IFS and Mobileye.

We see calendar year '23 as another growth year for us in these areas even though the absolute rate is difficult to predict today. This is in contrast to the semi market ex-memory, which third parties expect to decline low to mid-single digits. We entered 2023 with a view that much of the macro uncertainty of the last year is likely to persist, especially in the first half of the year. As such, we are laser-focused on executing to our $3 billion in calendar year '23 cost savings that we committed on our Q3 earnings call.

We are making tough decisions to rightsize the organization and we further sharpened our business focus within our BUs by rationalizing product road maps and investments. NEX continues to do well and is a core part of our strategic transformation, but we will end future investments in our network switching product line, while still fully supporting existing products and customers. Since my return, we have exited seven businesses, providing in excess of $1.5 billion in savings. We are also well underway to integrating AHG into CCG and DCI, respectively, to drive a more effective go-to-market capability, accelerating the scale of these businesses while further reducing costs.

While it was important to focus on what we are doing to address the current macro uncertainty, it is also important to highlight that despite disappointing financial results, calendar year '22 did see considerable progress toward our transformation. We remain fully committed to executing to our strategy to deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. Success starts with our people and execution follows culture. In calendar year '22, we took important strides to rebuild the leadership team promoting from within and adding fresh perspectives from the outside.

This includes the board of directors with the addition of Lip-Bu Tan and Barbara Novick, both of whom have already made significant contributions and the appointment of Frank Yeary as chair. In addition, a year ago, we reestablished OKRs to drive accountability and transparency across the organization, and we reintroduced TikTok 2 to establish a rigorous methodology of design and product development. Both are key spark plugs to our execution engine. Rebuilding the culture has begun to show benefits in manufacturing and design.

Our progress against our TV road map continue to improve throughout calendar year '22 and every quarter, our confidence grows. We are at/or ahead of our goal of five nodes in four years. Intel 7 is now in high-volume manufacturing for both client and server. On Intel 4, we are ready today for manufacturing, and we look forward to the Media Lake ramp in second half of the year.

"Google, Microsoft and the threat from overmighty trustbusters
2023-02-09T10:53:13Z

Which brings the story back to big tech. The winner-takes-all aspect of networks tends to eliminate competitors to the big tech giants. There is not much competition policy can do about such dominance. In theory, countless startups are vying to knock big tech firms from their perch, which ought to act as check on their business conduct. But so-called “shoot-out” acquisitions—purchases of startups that might become a rival to big tech firms—tend to neuter any threat from this corner. For many trustbusters, Facebook’s acquisition in 2012 of a fledgling Instagram was in this category. There are also regrets that Google’s acquisition in 2008 of DoubleClick, an ad server, helped to strengthen its hold on digital advertising, a market now the subject of a big antitrust probe.

Doubtless there were times when more vigilance was warranted. But it is easy to forget that the Chicago revolution was a response to overmighty trustbusters, who believed big was always bad and small businesses, however awful, should be shielded from competition. In America the courts are a check on over-enforcement. There are decades of jurisprudence, shaped by the Chicago School, which says non-horizontal mergers are benign. Nevertheless, the prospect of a court battle is enough to put off some firms. Last year Nvidia, a chipmaker, abandoned its proposed merger with , a chip designer, in the face of antitrust scrutiny.

It is telling that the has taken the lead in blocking mergers involving tech giants, such as Facebook and Microsoft. Britain’s trustbusters may now be among the most feared. Freed from the ’s competition policy, the revamped its guidelines in 2020 to give more weight to how post-merger markets might evolve. In Britain and Europe competition cases are pursued in an administrative system, not in a court, as in America. All of which gives the considerable powers. A rare example of a Brexit dividend? Trustbusters might say so. Not everyone would agree. ■

Peak concert demand, peak Ticketmaster rage: Even as smaller artists struggled with higher prices and equipment shortages last year, Live Nation Entertainment Inc. LYV, — the concert-industry gatekeeper that owns Ticketmaster and reports earnings Thursday — had a banner 2022 despite decades-high inflation. But higher ticket demand, higher ticket prices, and the record sales and profits Live Nation LYV, reaped from the concert industry’s post-lockdown comeback haven’t come without fan frustration and lawmaker scrutiny.

The company reportedly faces an antitrust investigation after the botched sale of Taylor Swift concert tickets last year, and the company faced questions from lawmakers last month. Joe Berchtold, Live Nation’s Chief Financial Officer, blamed the Swift debacle on a flood of online traffic from bots that he said overwhelmed Ticketmaster’s technological infrastructure.

How Russia’s war on Ukraine changed the global oil trade.

German stocks have been doing well of late. The DAX 40 was up 14.6% over the past three months at Thursday’s close, while the S&P 500 has gained 6.6%.. The chart below from Deutsche Bank partly explains the difference. Sliding energy costs in Europe over the winter, and more recently the opening up of China’s economy, have made German business leaders more optimistic, feeding into economic data.

It is surprises that most move markets. And the Eurozone data has been more positively surprising than those in the U.S.

“The big question for 2023 is whether the momentum in Europe and China and the recent loosening of global financial conditions can help offset some very worrying recent U.S. data. It’s possible that the global economy is normalising from the shock of the Ukraine war and China’s zero COVID policy and that this will help the U.S. in the near term,” said Deutsche strategist Jim Reid.

"Glimmers of Change Emerge on List of Top 50 Donors
2023-02-17T23:02:00Z

That’s because the Chronicle ranks donors by gifts and pledges made in a given year to private foundations and donor-advised funds in addition to nonprofits. Donations to a private foundation or DAF, may not be distributed for years to come, and the Chronicle doesn’t include annual disbursements from these vehicles to avoid double counting, according to an article on its methodology.

The list is a great way of measuring donor generosity, “but because it focuses on gifts to foundations, it doesn’t really capture what the money fully does,” Foster says.

Also, because not all wealthy donors give to a DAF or foundation each year, the list may not include donors who granted large amounts from established giving vehicles into the world to help individuals and society. That fact may offer some explanation for why only 20 of the 400 wealthiest individuals listed by Forbes are on the Chronicle’s list.

There are several reasons the publication focuses on gifts and pledges—including announcements of multi-year pledges—instead of grants, according to Maria Di Mento, senior reporter at the publication, who directs the annual Philanthropy 50 projects.

One is that the publication is trying to capture how much new money is being injected into philanthropy in a given year. Funds that are granted out by a foundation are not necessarily new.

There’s also no easy way to track annual grant giving. Nonprofit organizations report grants to the U.S. Treasury annually on IRS Form 990, but access to that data isn’t available until two years after the gifts are made.

More to the point, however, is the Chronicle’s readers—the heads of nonprofits and their major gift officers—want to know who is giving new money each year and where it is going, Di Mento says.

Donor Data Can Be Hard to Get

And the information isn’t easy to get. It involves talking to “dozens of charities, philanthropists, and their representatives,” according to the Chronicle.

Not every wealthy donor shares what they give, either. Consider Musk, the second wealthiest person in the world as of Friday, according to Forbes. The charitable gifts made by the CEO of Tesla and Twitter were only revealed after he divulged them in a mandatory Feb. 14 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission—a day after the Chronicle published its original list. According to the filings, Musk gave about US$1.95 billion in Tesla stock to “an unidentified charity or charities,” in seven donations from August to December, the Chronicle said.

The charities themselves weren’t listed, but the publication noted that Musk usually gives to charity through his foundation. The organization focuses on renewable energy, space exploration, pediatric research, and the “development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.”

The Chronicle’s list also doesn’t include gifts made last year by Mackenzie Scott, because she declined to provide the publication with the details of how much she put into her giving vehicles. The publication noted that she granted more than US$3.8 billion last year. “likely through three donor-advised funds,” named by the online magazine Puck.

Also missing is Melinda French Gates, who also didn’t provide information to the Chronicle, and Ann and John Doerr, who announced a US$1.1 billion pledge from their family foundation to create a school of sustainability at Stanford University.

“Any philanthropy 50 list is going to be idiosyncratic,” says David Campbell, professor of public administration at Binghamton University in New York. “It’s not representative of all giving.”

But some trends are notable. One is that several donors who show up consistently on the list such as Gates, Bloomberg, John and Laura Arnold, and Pierre and Pam Omidyar, have specific interests and they continue to invest in them.

Former investor John Arnold in Texas, for instance, whose Arnold Ventures focuses on criminal justice reform, healthcare reform, higher education, and democracy, has a clear strategic vision and uses his foundation to act on it.

The model comes with 13th-gen Intel Core processors, a 13.3-inch OLED display, a 12-inch E Ink display, noise-canceling microphones, and improved wireless connectivity. It is priced at $1,649 and will be available this June.
Ultra-thin and lightweight, LG Gram Ultraslim weights about two pounds and is slightly thicker on one side to make room for ports. It boasts a 15.6-inch OLED display, a 13th-gen Intel Raptor Lake processor, and a customizable storage space of up to 512GB. Pricing is currently unavailable, but the model will be available overseas in February and in the U.S. later this year.
Aside from showcasing aforementioned advancements in laptop technology, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) and Nvidia Corp. used this year’s CES to vie for dominance in the market for AI acceleration chips. AMD CEO and Chair Lisa Su introduced the Instinct MI300 chip, a combined central processing and graphics processing unit meant for AI acceleration. The chip is billed as “world’s first data-center integrated CPU + GPU”, and Su claims it can reduce the time it takes for an inference modeling process to weeks from months.
AMD doesn’t stop there; it introduced its Alveo V70 AI Accelerator, which boosts “energy efficiency for multiple AI inference workloads.” The company also announced it will release laptops with RX 7000-series graphics based on the AMD RDNA 3 architecture that offer “exceptional energy efficiency” and can run 30-plus hours of video on a single battery charge.
From powerful mobile technology to larger screens for gaming laptops and AI acceleration chips, the industry clearly is commited to making laptops more capable, efficient, and cost-friendly for a broad range of users. With the emergence of larger and more powerful models, combined with AI acceleration chips, the laptop industry could be poised to make a major comeback and reclaim its stake in the PC market."

"3 Nvidia Stock Predictions for 2023
2023-01-12T11:47:00Z

As I mentioned at the onset, Nvidia stock has fallen roughly 53% from its high reached in late 2021. Yet the company continues to steal share, commanding 88% of the discrete desktop GPU market in the third quarter -- its highest level ever.

Furthermore, the company's valuation is low by historical standards, though it still isn't cheap in terms of traditional valuation metrics. Nvidia currently sells for 13 times next year's sales, when a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is generally considered to be between 1 and 2. Still, that's a small price to pay given the company's industry-leading position and history of execution.

I'm not really going out on a limb saying Nvidia's stock price will recover in 2023."
"Better Buy: Nvidia vs. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock
2023-01-17T13:45:00Z
For comparison, investing in a stock like Home Depot is a way to indirectly bet on the housing market instead of investing directly in a home builder. Or investing in Caterpillar is a good way to bet on construction, oil and gas, or mining instead of directly buying an exploration and production oil and gas stock.
Nvidia stock could outperform Taiwan Semi if it continues to out-innovate its competitors. But that is a relatively riskier proposition than just going with Taiwan Semi, which has a far better risk/reward profile than Nvidia.
Two good options worth considering now
Nvidia and Taiwan Semi operate on different sides of the semiconductor industry. Nvidia has done a masterful job of diversifying its business to include gaming, datacenter, AI, and autonomous vehicles. But for now, the AI and autonomous vehicle side of its business remains a sideshow, while data center and gaming performance are highly cyclical. That being said, Nvidia is positioned to outlast downturns while still being able to invest in multi-decade trends.
Meanwhile, Taiwan Semi is poised to continue outspending its competitors to retain its industry-leading manufacturing profile. As the industry evolves and becomes more complex, Taiwan Semi has the margins and cash flow necessary to make necessary improvements.
Aside from being different companies, both stocks have contrasting investment theses. Nvidia offers arguably more upside with its potential to be a leader in industries that could unlock untold value. But it's also a more expensive stock that lacks a meaningful dividend yield. By contrast, Taiwan Semi should enjoy steady growth in lockstep with the overall industry."

Now let me turn it back to Colette on gaming.

Thanks, Jensen. Gaming revenue of $1.83 billion was up 16% sequentially and down 46% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $9.07 billion is down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by the strong reception of our 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs based on the Ada Lovelace architecture.

The year-on-year decline reflects the impact of channel inventory correction, which is largely behind us. And demand in the seasonally strong fourth quarter was solid in most regions. While China was somewhat impacted by disruptions related to COVID, we are encouraged by the early signs of recovery in that market. Gamers are responding enthusiastically to the new RTX4090, 4080, 4070 Ti desktop GPUs, with many retail and online outlets quickly selling out of stock.

The flagship RTX 4090 has quickly shot up in popularity on Steam to claim the top spot for the AI architecture, reflecting gamers' desire for high-performance graphic. Earlier this month, the first phase of gaming laptops based on the Ada architecture reached retail shelves, delivering NVIDIA's largest-ever generational leap in performance and power efficiency. For the first time, we are bringing enthusiast-class GPU performance to laptops as slim as 14 inches, a fast-growing segment, previously limited to basic tasks and apps. In another first, we are bringing the 90 class GPUs, our most performing models, to laptops, thanks to the power efficiency of our fifth-generation Max-Q technology.

All in, RTX 40 Series GPUs will power over 170 gaming and creator laptops, setting up for a great back-to-school season. There are now over 400 games and applications supporting NVIDIA's RTX technology for real-time ray tracing and AI-powered graphics. The AI architecture features DLSS 3, our third-generation AI-powered graphics, which massively boosts performance. With the most advanced games, Cyberpunk 2077, recently added DLSS 3 enabling three to four x boosts in frame rate performance at 4K resolution.

Our GeForce Now cloud gaming service continued to expand in multiple dimensions, users, titles, and performance. It now has more than 25 million members in over 100 countries. Last month, it enabled RTX 4080 graphics horsepower in the new high-performance ultimate membership tier. Ultimate members can stream at up to 240 frames per second from a cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3.

And just yesterday, we made an important announcement with Microsoft. We agreed to a 10-year partnership to bring to GeForce Now Microsoft's lineup of Xbox PC games, which includes blockbusters like Minecraft, Halo and Flight Simulator. And upon the close of Microsoft's Activision acquisition, it will add titles like Call of Duty and Overwatch. Moving to pro visualization.

Revenue of $226 million was up 13% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $1.54 billion was down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by desktop workstations with strengths in the automotive and manufacturing industrial verticals. Year-on-year decline reflects the impact of the channel inventory correction, which we expect to end in the first half of the year.

Interest in NVIDIA's Omniverse continues to build with almost 300,000 downloads so far, 185 connectors to third-party design applications. The latest released Omniverse has a number of features and enhancements, including support for 4K, real-time path tracing, Omniverse Search for AI-powered search through large untagged 3D databases, and Omniverse cloud containers for AWS. Let's move to automotive. Revenue was a record $294 million, up 17% and up 135% from a year ago.

This cybersecurity leader is also in good financial shape, which gives it the ability to keep playing offense. For example, it recently acquired a company that specializes in software supply chain security. Most software today, including AI, is virtually ""assembled"" with smaller pieces of software, pieces that need to be protected as they travel from one developer to the next. Palo Alto's recent purchase could thus help fill a critical need as new AI systems get rapidly deployed in the coming years.

Palo Alto can afford to make these occasional bolt-on purchases of smaller peers. It generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow over the last 12-month period, more than enough to make acquisitions and fund its share repurchase program (which is currently being used to offset the effects of employee stock-based compensation).

Palo Alto Networks stock currently trades for just under 22 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. For a company that expects to grow at least 20% in the next year and sustain high levels of cash profits, this looks like a very fair price to me. I remain a buyer."
"Beth Kindig on AI, Semiconductors, and Tech Cycles
2023-02-18T15:09:00Z

In one way, I guess the markets used to be very timid around how they basically run in cycles, but to some extent, Nvidia, AMD, TSM, they have better visibility because these budgets have to be allocated far in advance. That's helpful, especially given the reduced spending we may see from enterprise budgets or consumer budgets or consumer marketing-related budgets, I should say. Ultimately though, we are overweight, not only for the fact that that rebound is nicely timed to the collapse that Nvidia had with crypto mining and AMD had with PCs, that was a Q3 collapse, if you will. Their comps are much easier come the following year, specifically in Q3.

But I also like their AI positioning and as much as you're hearing about things like ChatGPT, the T in that stands for transformer, Nvidia powers that and so what I like is if you're going to give me depressed prices and if you're going to give me a shallow or deep recession, there's is still out on which way it will go, I want to build my AI positions as cheap as possible, and therefore I feel like it's a win-win, where I'm getting to build cheap AI positions given all the deep discounts we have, but I also have some visibility into how it might close out the year of these companies, which presumably will be higher price than where we're starting because of that H2 rebound, which has now been echoed across two management teams. I'd love to get that third in about two weeks from now from Nvidia. So that's what we're looking for.

Deidre Woollard: IPOs have to come back at some point. It's probably not going to be a super robust year for venture capital and for IPOs, but what are you looking for in the long term? Are there lessons that venture capital learned during this time period? Are companies going to wait longer before they IPO. Is there a little more cautious and its now baked into this cycle?

Beth Kindig: Yes, so money could potentially dry up. I am very firm on the fact that the dotcom bust is not what we're looking at because technology today plays a much greater role in a very important role. But I will say that some of the parallels around the private markets are there, which is just this exuberant level of funding. So many companies were able to raise rounds and according to some of the research that we've done, that has not caught up yet to the VC market and it's more likely that it will hurt the VC market this year. What happens is that you're a mid-sized start-up and you're not able to raise more money so you start to go out of business. The more they go out of business, the more zeros VCs have, the harder it is for them to raise their next rounds for funding from their limited partners so it has a domino effect.

It takes longer than the public markets and I think what you saw in the public markets this last year is going to catch up to VCs. It just is going to take a little bit longer of a squeeze, which is start-ups run out of money, they go to raise money, the money is not there, the VCs who funded that angel, that Series A, whatever it is lose that money because there's no more to raise and that is important because almost all of them, the high hyper-growth, new growth companies coming out the gate through a public offering. So the IPOs will slow because fewer Series C, let's just say Series B, Series C rounds are going to happen, which means they'll be fewer that get up to maturity, Series D or F that then will go public and without that, we're going to have far fewer hybrid growth on the market and then that affects tech in general as well.

One thing I would characterize about the dotcom bust, let's say is you did have an Amazon and a Netflix, but they were just very few hyper-growth companies coming onto the market not only because of some of the macro backdrop but because the IPO market had gone bust and the venture world had gone entirely bust. It ruined people. We like to talk a lot about how the public markets ruined people from the dot-com bust, but the venture world was ruined as well so a lot of people lost a lot of money. That's coming probably and I follow some people on Twitter and I have to think about their names right now. I have to get back to you on that, but some of them are really very interesting data points on it that I've been following so tech investors should keep an eye on that.

"Interview With David Rolfe of Wedgewood Partners
2023-02-17T20:48:00Z

Rotonti: How do you measure management quality, and can you please give us an example of a CEO (either in your portfolio or not) that you think does it right?

Rolfe: Quality is a mosaic. High-quality managements demonstrate capital allocation excellence over product, service, industry, and economic cycles. Quality managements treat all shareholders as partners. Quality managements deliver bad news quick. Quality managements are honest, humble, and transparent. High-quality managements understand that growth without profits is rarely a long-term plan.

We think that all of our invested company CEOs are paragons of quality, but I'd like to call out CEO Greg Brown of Motorola Solutions. Starting in 2015, Brown has spent over $5 billion acquiring 22 companies that span public and private safety, from land mobile radio communications to video security and building access control, combined with command center software. In all, Brown has transformed Motorola Solutions into a near-monopoly platform company with 50% recurring revenues. In 1987, Harvard Business School presented a case study on retiring CEO Bob Galvin, who was the son of the founder of Motorola. HBS needs to do the same with Brown.

Rotonti: Do you have any performance metrics that you prefer management compensation be based on?

Rolfe: We prefer compensation to be largely based on some form of return on capital metrics.

Rotonti: How long does it typically take for a brand-new idea to make it into the portfolio from the first day of research to the day you hit the buy button?

Rolfe: It typically takes more than a few months, sometimes years if the stock's valuation doesn't come in enough. That said, over the past 30 years, we have found that if we identify a great business that we endeavor to own, the market usually will serve it up on the valuations terms we demand.

Rotonti: What financial data tools does your team use such as Bloomberg, FactSet, New Constructs, HOLT, or others?

Rotonti: What is your definition of an investment thesis?

Rolfe: An investment thesis is a set of overlapping understandings and facts of what made a company outstanding in the past, and our assumptions of a continued entrenched competitive advantages that will allow said company to continue to prosper and grow at industry-leading rates so that it will be great over the ensuing years.

Rotonti: How important is valuation to your process?

Rolfe: Critical. We are buying a share in a business, but that share must be valued at a reasonable discount to what we believe that business is worth today, tomorrow, and in the future.

Rotonti: What valuation tools and metrics does your team use? Do you build discounted cash flow models? Do you look at P/E ratios and free cash flow yields? Something else?

Rolfe: We incorporate a myriad of valuation measures. Critically, we are always inverting the traditional DDM by asking ourselves, ""What's in the stock price?"" Oftentimes, our earnings estimates may not differ much from consensus, but what the market prices in on earnings expectations can vary greatly. That shorter-term valuation discrepancy, coupled with our time arbitrage as longer-term investors perfectly illustrates the maxim, as mentioned earlier, ""Price is what you pay; value is what you get.""

Rotonti: When picking stocks, do you consider an upside potential-to-downside potential ratio? If so, what do you look for?

Rolfe: Yes, we do. We don't employ a hard, fast ratio, but we look for a multiple of upside versus potential downside risk. It is a mixture of quantitative and qualitative. This embodies what John Train called, ""The Craft of Investing.""

Rotonti: Do you incorporate a macro view into your stock picking and portfolio management? If so, what is your current macro outlook?

Rolfe: Macro view, not so much at all. Industry economic views, absolutely.

Rotonti: How do you factor interest rates into your stock picking and portfolio management?

Rolfe: No, not too much. In the extreme, yes. For example, during the zero-interest rates borne of quantitative easing, for years we avoided reducing the required return rate of our stock selections to absurdly low levels, which propelled far too many ""growth companies"" to absurdly ridiculous valuations. We all know what happened starting in early 2021, when Fed Chairman Powell began whispering a change to a tighter monetary policy.

"RingCentral (RNG) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-02-16T05:00:24Z

Also, yesterday, we announced an extended and expanded agreement to our strategic partnership with Avaya, with significantly improved terms. Avaya Cloud Office by RingCentral remains Avaya's exclusive multi-tenant U.K. solution to Avaya customers. Avaya continues to hold the world's largest base of unified communications on-prem users and we remain best positioned to migrate this base to the cloud.

Looking ahead, there are hundreds of millions of on-prem seats that are still to be migrated and where we have the right to win every day. There is tremendous product market fit and we have the product, partnerships, and most importantly, people, to capture this large, untapped opportunity that is still in front of us. With that, let me turn the call over to Mo to discuss in more detail what we are seeing in the market today.

Thanks, Vlad. We continue to execute well and deliver solid results in the current environment. Upmarket new logo acquisition was robust. Also, our net retention rate in Q4 was again over 100%, demonstrating our ability to both land and expand, and driven in part by continued strength within our Contact Center, which grew above the company average.

Our Contact Center brings together the world's leading UC and CC. In the latest 2022 Gartner Critical Capabilities for Unified Communications as a Service worldwide report, RingCentral ranked first in the UC with an integrated Contact Center use case, ahead of 11 other vendors. And the reason why is tightly integrated functionality that benefits customers of all sizes with unique, differentiated experiences. First, for agents, our integrated solution offers seamless access to other non-Contact Center employees across the business and the ability to share simple context for the interaction.

And two, for supervisors, our performance management solution, Contact Center Pulse, provides real-time alerts on agent performance KPIs using our messaging technology. This allows supervisors to react to changing interaction volumes and agent performance instantly. Our customers also get an end-to-end experience with seamless billing, faster implementation, and integrated support. As Vlad mentioned, there are hundreds of millions of seats in the verticals and geographies that we are actively selling in today.

We are mission-critical to industries such as healthcare, financial services, retail, education, and professional services, where real-time customer interaction is essential to the ability to operate. For example, Aspen Dental, one of the largest dental service organizations in the U.S.; Community Health Plan of Washington; and Viva Health were all $1 million-plus TCV healthcare wins this quarter. They selected RingCentral because we address key priorities for them such as HIPAA compliance, increasing staff efficiency, and patient engagements, and of course, reducing care coordination friction. Our differentiation is clearly a driving factor in helping us win not just in healthcare but also within the Teams ecosystem.

We're successful with Teams users because of our unmatched and mission-critical capabilities. First, we offer Five9s of uptime, native PSTN to over 45 countries, and out-of-the-box analytics and reporting. Second, we also have numerous deep integrations into both our Contact Center solution, as well as leading technology applications such as Google, Salesforce, and ServiceNow. And third, we enable native SMS and vertical-specific capabilities and integrations that many of our core customers need to do their job.

This has resulted in triple-digit growth in the fourth quarter and increasing penetration of the Teams base. We continue to see this as an opportunity for future growth. Now moving on to partnerships. On Avaya, we are pleased with the new extended and expanded agreement, which now includes minimum seat commitments and a better-aligned incentive structure intended to drive accelerated migration to Avaya Cloud Office.

We expect to see renewed focus in selling ACO after Avaya finalizes their recapitalization. We expect that Avaya will emerge stronger and better positioned to migrate the world's largest on-premises installed base to Avaya Cloud Office by RingCentral, the best UCaaS destination for every Avaya unified communications customer. Regarding Mitel, we continue to see strong traction since we entered into our strategic partnership in November of 2021, with sequential growth in new seat sales every quarter of 2022. In addition to our strategic partners, our channel and GSP partners continue to be integral to our success, providing us with broad distribution and helping us expand our addressable customer base.

"Tesla (TSLA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-01-26T05:30:27Z

Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term. However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year. Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map. This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business.

We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our investor day in a month. Thank you.

Thank you very much, Zach. Let's now go to investor questions. The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter. This has raised demand concerns.

Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates? I think --

We already answered that question.

Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.

Thank you. The second question is in similar vein. What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels? We've answered that one as well. So let's go to the next one.

The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells/packs, so $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour, for autos and energy products? And how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?

I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some. Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant. You can do the math. If we were to get anywhere near 1,000 gigawatt-hours of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant.

So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing. And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits. So it will -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic. We think it probably will be very significant in the future.

Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we're expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year. So different products, we think, will get different amounts of credit. The regulations here are still in flux and there continues to be updates, so this is just our best understanding at the moment. But we think on the order of $150 million to $250 million per quarter this year and growing over the course of the year as our volumes grow.

And part of the work we're doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying to incentivize, is, as Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, which is Tesla's plans anyways. And so, I think we're pretty well positioned over the coming years to take advantage of this. But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from our customers. And so, we also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are in our products going forward.

And so, as we're thinking about our pricing changes in the U.S. a couple of weeks ago that we announced, we were looking at what the credit benefit to Tesla would be to make sure that customers are able to receive the benefit not only from this that were received to some extent, but also on the consumer-facing side, which is currently $7,500 per car of tax credit, assuming that -- subject to the MSRP caps and the income caps. So we want to use this to accelerate sustainable energy, which is our mission and also the goal of this bill.

Thank you very much. The next question from investors is, after recent price cuts, analysts released expectations that Tesla automotive gross margin, excluding leasing and credits, will drop below 20% and average selling price around $47,000 across all models. Where do you see average selling price and gross margins after the price cuts?

"Intel (INTC) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-01-27T02:00:22Z

Intel 3 continues to show great health and is on track. Intel 4 and 3 are our first modes deploying EUV, and will represent a major step forward in terms of transistor performance per watt and density. On Intel 20A and Intel 18A, the first nodes to benefit from RibbonFETs and PowerVia, internal test chips and those of a major potential foundry customer have taped out with the silicon running in the fab. We continue to be on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025.

Progress in TD continues to be validated by our IFS pipeline. I am happy that we were able to add a leading cloud edge and data center solutions provider as a leading edge customer for Intel 3 including prior customers. Such as MediaTek, we now have lifetime deal value of greater than $4 billion for IFS. We also have an active pipeline engagements with seven out of the 10 largest foundry customers coupled with consistent pipeline growth to include 43 potential customers and ecosystem partner test chips.

Additionally, we continue to make progress on Intel E&A, and I've already shared the engineering release of PDK0.5 with our lead customers and expect to have the final production release in the next few weeks. In addition, we are working hard to complete the Tower acquisition, which will further amplify our momentum as our foundry business becomes even more compelling to customers. On the product front, the PRQ of Sapphire Rapids in Q3 and the formal introduction of our fourth gen Xeon scalable CPU and Xeon CPU MAX series better known to many of U.S. Sapphire Rapids and Sapphire Rapids HBM, respectively, on January 10 was a great milestone.

It was particularly satisfying to host a customer-centered events, including testimonials from Dell, Google Cloud, HPE, Lenovo, Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA, among many others. We are thrilled to be ramping production to meet a strong backlog of demand, and we are on track to ship 1 million units by midyear. In addition, as part of AHG moves into DCAi, it is noteworthy that our Intel Flex series optimized for and showing clear leadership in media stream density and visual quality is now shifting initial deployments with large CSPs and MNCs, enabling large-scale cloud gaming and media delivery deployments. Our DC AI road map only improves from here and will ratio sampling and has completed power on with top OEM and CSP customers, and it remains on track to launch in the second half of 2023.

Granite Rapids, our next performance core addition to the Xeon portfolio is on track to launch in 2024, running multiple operating systems across many different configurations. Further, our first efficient core product, CFR is also on track for 2024. Lastly, it is appropriate to continue to highlight PSG for its standout performance delivering record Q4 revenue up 42% year on year. We are planning to have a more fulsome look at our progress in BCEI at our next investor webinar later in Q1.

Stay tuned for the invitation. In CCG, we continue to build on our market share momentum across the PC stack by focusing on delivering leadership products with our broad open ecosystem. I'm particularly pleased that our clear performance leadership at the high end drove record client ASPs in the quarter. In Q4, the 13th Gen Intel Core desktop processor family, codename, Raptor Lake, became available, starting with the desktop K processors and the Intel Z 790 chipset.

In partnership with Tasos, we officially set a new world record for overclocking, pushing the 13th Gen Intel Core past the 9 gigahertz barrier for the first time ever. Hands down, we provide desktop enthusiasts and gamers with the best processors and features for overclocking in the PC industry. We also introduced our notebook Raptor Lake family at CES, including the world's fastest notebook CPU and the first 24 cores. We look forward to ramping the more than 300 mobile design wins we have already secured in the first half of '23.

Media Lake, our first disaggregated CPU built on Intel 4, remains on track for the second half of the year. And with Media Lake progressing well, it's now appropriate to look forward to Lunar Lake, which is on track for production readiness in 2024, having taped out its first silicon. Lunar Lake is optimized for ultra-low power performance, which will enable more of our PC partners to create ultrathin and light systems for mobile users. In addition, as we outlined on our webinar, we are excited by the strength of the EVO brand.

"Glimmers of Change Emerge on List of Top 50 Donors
2023-02-17T23:02:00Z

Giving was likely higher from this group of donors in recent years because the pandemic and social and racial unrest put philanthropy “front and center,” Campbell says. “That forced at a national level some introspection about wealth inequality, about the challenges created by the pandemic, and that might have led to some increases in giving.”

Last year, rising inflation and stock market drops of as much as 33% could have caused these donors to take a pause. “They had less cash or they may have had fewer tax liabilities,” he says.

Now that inflation appears to be abating and the stock market is performing somewhat better, “we might see an upswing,” Campbell says."
"Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-02-23T01:30:32Z

Sequential growth was driven primarily by AI automotive solutions. New program ramps at both electric vehicle and traditional OEM customers helped drive this growth. Fiscal year revenue of $903 million was up 60%. At CES, we announced a strategic partnership with Foxconn to develop automated and autonomous vehicle platforms.

This partnership will provide scale for volume, manufacturing to meet growing demand for the NVIDIA Drive platform. Foxconn will use NVIDIA Drive, Hyperion compute, and sensor architecture for its electric vehicles. Foxconn will be a Tier 1 manufacturer producing electronic control units based on NVIDIA Drive Orin for the global automotive vehicles. We also reached an important milestone this quarter.

The NVIDIA Drive operating system received safety certification from TUV SUD, one of the most experienced and rigorous assessment bodies in the automotive industry. With industry-leading performance and functional safety, our platform meets the higher standards required for autonomous transportation. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 63.3%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%.

Fiscal year GAAP gross margin was 56.9%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2%. Year on year, Q4 GAAP operating expenses were up 21%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 23%, primarily due to the higher compensation and data center infrastructure expenses. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were flat, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%. We plan to keep them relatively flat at this level over the coming quarters.

Full year GAAP operating expenses were up 50%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 31%. We returned $1.15 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q4, we had approximately %7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Let me look to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal '24.

We expect sequential growth to be driven by each of our four major market platforms led by strong growth in data center and gaming. Revenue is expected to be $6.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 66.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.53 billion.

Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $50 million, excluding gains and losses of nonaffiliated divestments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million for the first quarter and in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year 2024.

Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on March 6th in San Francisco and the Cowen Healthcare Conference on March 7th in Boston. We will also host GTC virtually with Jensen's keynote kicking off on March 21st.

Our earnings call to discuss the results of our first quarter of fiscal year '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 24th. Now we will open up the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?

[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.

Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Clearly, on this call, a key focal point is going to be the monetization effect of your software and cloud strategy. I think as we look at it, I think, straight up, the enterprise AI software suite, I think, is priced at around $6,000 per CPU socket.

I think you've got pricing metrics a little bit higher for the cloud consumption model. I'm just curious, Colette, how do we start to think about that monetization contribution to the company's business model over the next couple of quarters relative to, I think, in the past, you've talked like a couple of hundred million or so? Just curious if you can unpack that a little bit.

"Beth Kindig on AI, Semiconductors, and Tech Cycles
2023-02-18T15:09:00Z

Deidre Woollard: For some of the companies that maybe IPO'd too fast or that are grossly unprofitable at this point, do you think we're going to see more mergers and acquisitions? We've already seen a little bit starting to happen this year, certain companies being taken private other companies being folded in, how much are you watching that aspect of what might unfold?

Beth Kindig: That's a great question. I don't think enough people are asking what will happen if the previous Wall Street darlings don't survive or run out of money and valuations remain low for a long time, which makes it harder to raise money. Overall, what I would say is that in verticals like Cloud consolidation is coming but actually let me back up. The weird part right now is nobody knows how deep or shallow the recession is.

Beth Kindig: Yeah, we're in a really strange moment here. On the positive side, it would be early 2024 when we come out of the recession. There are certainly some analysts' estimates predicting that if you look at, for instance, Facebook's return to growth supposedly they're going to return to growth back half of 2023 and into 2024. That's for every company almost that I've tracked, far majority, let's say 80 percent. Anyways, let's say it's a shallow recession then M&A may not happen at the level that you would normally think it would. Let's say it's a deep recession which would swipe out 2023, 2024. We go all through 2024 with these low valuations, tech out of favor, M&A will really pick up and it'll be survival of the fittest.

The public markets haven't been through this for so long that people probably think I'm talking doom and gloom but I'm not because it's actually just a pretty natural process where these VCs, actually, speaking of VCs, they will fund a lot of start-ups, push them off into the public markets. They actually get an exit from that. They get paid pretty well if they go public, but can those companies survive long-term? That's not even a question they care to answer. It's not important to some of the insiders or the VCs. It's imperative though for public investors to figure that piece out. Can the company that did so great as a hyper-growth start-up, are they able to have a strong bottom line to get through in a time when cash is scarce? It's not going to be able to raise like you were when you were a start-up so basically that's the big question mark.

In that case, mergers and acquisitions would really pick up, the strongest would pick up the weakest if they're lucky, and the rest would go out of business if they're not lucky so you can expect a percentage of the public markets, companies, stocks, former Wall Street darlings to go out of business or have to sell, be eaten up by the strongest companies with the biggest cash levels and that would all greatly depend on how deep the recession is, but it's a pretty natural process this is not a doom and gloom. It's actually just how tech operates and it goes through that about every 10-15 years and we're far long due since the great financial crisis for it. Mobile actually had a bust cycle. Already, gaming how-to-bust cycle. Zynga is a great example. It was a darling that I think they are still around but they're not valued for worth much so near-zero at that point.

Deidre Woollard: Want to ask you because I was really looking forward to talking to you about generative AI and the buzz that we're right in the middle of now with OpenAI and ChatGPT and we've got the AI art trend. Everyone is so excited about generative AI right now. What should investors be thinking about with that? Is it focused on Microsoft or what do you thinking?

Beth Kindig: ChatGPT was a nice catalyst or a nice headline around AI. There'll be so many AI tools, AI apps, even image generation tools, things like that thousands basically, over the next 5-10 years. ChatGPT happens to be one of the first that is getting widespread attention, which is great. Beneath all of that though, you do have Microsoft and you also have Nvidia and I would look for those companies that are going to participate, no matter what the OpenAI called mainly R&D firm or company no matter where it's coming out of or who's making the app or company.

"Interview With David Rolfe of Wedgewood Partners
2023-02-17T20:48:00Z

Rotonti: Do you read Wall Street research and do you find it helpful?

Rolfe: Sure. There are many excellent Street analysts, particularly those analysts who have proven a high level of industry knowledge. That said, we don't pay much attention to Wall Street price targets and such.

Rotonti: When do you trim and when do you sell out of a stock completely?

Rolfe: Sales and/or trims are made due to the following: Full valuation. Recognizing mistakes. New and better risk-adjusted opportunities. Resizing positions due to industry concentration and other position-size considerations.

Rotonti: In your opinion, is the S&P 500 undervalued and are you finding cheap stocks to invest in?

Rolfe: The beauty of being invested in just 20 stocks is that you don't need to have an opinion on the valuation of the stock market. It is quite rare if some terrific company's stock isn't ""on sale."" Warren Buffett has been quite clear over the decades admonishing investors that the ""stock market is there to serve you, not instruct you."" If any investor, lay or professional, can figure out Buffett's admonishment (plus understand and practice chapters 8 and 20 in Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor), they will be miles ahead of the investing game.

Rotonti: What is one company you'd love to own stock in at the right price?

Rolfe: Ha! I'd tell you, but then I'd have to charge you a client fee! Let's just say there a just a couple of extraordinary high-end retailers and semiconductor companies that are beyond compare in their own respective ways.

Rotonti: Your largest position is Motorola Solutions. Please tell us why this deserves to be your largest position.

Rolfe: Motorola is the dominant market leader in its core land mobile radio (LMR) business: providing infrastructure, handsets, and related software and services for customized, highly resilient, secure networks for global police and emergency services, a variety of government and military applications, and other commercial and public safety applications where security and reliability are of the utmost importance. The company has continued to find success in using its entrenched position in these mission-critical networks to layer in faster-growing and higher-margin software, service, and video products. It is the only player capable of fully integrating the entire service offering with its core LMR network backbone.

Motorola has assembled this stable of complementary products and services largely through acquisition, using the steady, recurring cash flows the LMR business has provided. These purchases not only have been attractive strategically; they have been extremely attractive financially, as well.

The U.S. federal government has been creating (and continues to create) massive stimulus funding for state and local governments, as well as other Motorola customers such as FEMA, school districts, and airport and transit operators. Although this funding typically does not appear immediately and may take some time to find its way from a news headline to an actual customer's budget, the company has highlighted funding already available to customers in the region of $350 billion for state and local governments, $170 billion for education, and $38 billion for airport and transit. The company expects to see the benefit of this funding through 2024, when the current rounds of stimulus expire.

Rotonti: What is your investment thesis in Meta (META -0.96%)?

Rolfe: If you build it, they will come. With apologies to W.P. Kinsella, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has built it. And they did come. And they have stayed. By the billions. The metaverse will be the next evolutionary chapter by Meta Platforms. And speaking of billions: Meta Platforms' family of apps (FoA: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger) currently has over 3.7 billion monthly active users -- this includes almost 3 billion daily active users. If baseball is sports' national pastime, family of apps is the social national pastime. The International Telecommunications Network (ITU) estimates that of the 8 billion in world population, nearly 3 billion are without an internet connection. If you exclude China's population (where U.S. social media companies are largely banned), Meta Platforms' family of apps are used monthly by a staggering 90% of the world's connected population and by 70% on a daily basis. This level of user engagement and density across the company's FoAs would seem to be an impenetrable fortress. It surely has been in the continued growth and stickiness in terms of users.

"RingCentral (RNG) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-02-16T05:00:24Z

Leads generated by our channel partners increased over 30% year over year in Q4. Channel partners continue to pick RingCentral because of our leading product and the ease of working with us. Our GSP partners continue to drive stable growth and we look forward to the continued ramp of new partners such as Charter and Vodafone. On international, we continue to gain traction with almost triple the number of $1 million-plus TCV deals in Q4 versus the prior year.

Now turning to what we're seeing in the field. Our Q4 pipeline was up versus last year and our win rates continue to be steady and strong. However, the conversion of these opportunities continues to be impacted by the current macro environment. Cycle times remain elongated versus last year, with initial deployment sizes down both year over year and versus Q3.

Customers continue to understand how we are able to save them money while also enhancing their communications channels. But in this environment, timing and deal size remain headwinds. What we can control is being more efficient in our go-to-market activities. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue demonstrated solid year-over-year improvement in Q4.

And there is more to come as the impact of the efficiency actions we took in 2022 will be fully realized this year. We have also executed on additional actions to make our go-to-market more efficient going forward. This includes: one, evolving our partnerships to improve overall economics for all parties; two, reducing support functions in sales while investing in front-line sales capacity; three, lowering upfront commissions costs across our partners and direct sellers while also allowing top performers to earn more; and four, continuing to be disciplined on marketing spend, which thus far has yielded better leads with improved conversion rates and at a lower cost. In summary, we continue to execute well in the current environment.

Our ability to help customers save money while increasing their efficiency has not changed. We are continuing to look at all aspects of our go-to-market to ensure we are as efficient as possible for when macro conditions improve, setting us up well for more profitable growth going forward. Now I'll pass it over to Sonalee to discuss our financials and business outlook.

Thanks, Mo. Before I discuss our performance and 2023 outlook, I wanted to reflect on what we achieved in 2022. As Vlad said, we are among a select group of SaaS companies with over $2 billion in ARR and subscription gross margins of over 80%. We clearly demonstrated the power of our business model at scale as we solidly exceeded our profitability goals in 2022 against a dynamic and challenging macro backdrop.

We are a significantly more profitable company as we enter 2023. Now turning to our Q4 performance. Subscriptions revenue of $502 million was up 19% year over year and in line with our guidance range. On a constant currency basis, subscriptions revenue rose 21% year over year.

ARPU was once again stable across both UCaaS and CCaaS, with overall and new acquisition ARPU holding steady above $30. Importantly, new customer ARPU is being generated at more attractive unit economics as customer acquisition costs improve. Moving to profitability. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 14% set another quarterly record and was up over 300 basis points year over year driven by efficiencies generated across the business, most notably in sales and marketing.

Now moving to full year '22. Subscriptions revenue of $1.89 billion was up 27% year over year. On a constant currency basis, subscriptions revenues rose 29% year over year. Total revenue of $1.99 billion was up 25% year over year.

On a constant currency basis, total revenue rose 26%. Our ability to deliver a clearly differentiated product that is highly valued by our sticky customer base continues to generate industry-leading subscription gross margin, which came in at 82.4% in 2022. Moving to ARR. We delivered $2.1 billion of ARR, up 17% year over year and 19% on a constant currency basis.

Yes, I'll jump in on this. So there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about how the year will unfold, but I'll share what's in our current forecast for a moment. So based upon these metrics here, we believe that we'll be above both of the metrics that are stated in the question, so 20% automotive gross margin, excluding leases and credits, and then $47,000 ASP across all models. And so, two other comments I want to make on this, just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1.

And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices. As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we're delivering cars to at a lower price book given that backlogs had been so long for so much of 2022. But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs. The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we're most focused on what our operating margin is.

And so, as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing faster than the vehicle business, and as we're heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin. And so, I wanted to make sure that I shared that with the investor community as well because that is what we're primarily managing to now.

Yes. Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand but I think a lot of others maybe don't is that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software, to have full self-driving enabled, and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly. So that's actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a small percentage of cars don't have Hardware 3. So that means that there's millions of cars where full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100% gross margin.

And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows. And then, when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet. That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history. Yes.

Thank you. Let's go to the next investor question. Since Elon started political influencing, polls from Morning Consult and YouGov show Tesla brand.

YouGov. You can crush them with your life.

Show Tesla brand favorability declining in 2022 and division among partisan lines. Such brand damage can impact demand. Does Tesla track favorability? And how will any brand image be mitigated?

Well, let me check my Twitter account. OK, so I've got 127 million followers. It continues to grow very rapidly. That suggests that I'm reasonably popular.

It might not be popular with some people, but for the vast majority of people, my follower count speaks for itself. I have the most interactive account -- social media account, I think, maybe in the world, certainly on Twitter, and that actually predated the Twitter acquisition. So I think Twitter is actually an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for Tesla. And I would really encourage companies out there of all kinds, automotive or otherwise, to make more use of Twitter and to use their Twitter accounts in ways that are interesting and informative, entertaining, and it will help them drive sales just as it has with Tesla.

So the net value of Twitter, apart from a few people are complaining, is gigantic, obviously.

Thank you. Let's go to the next question. Please provide a detailed explanation of where you are on the 4680 ramp? What are the current roadblocks? And when do you expect to scale to 10,000 vehicles a year -- a week?

Yes. Thanks, Martin. First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla 4680 team for achieving 1,000 a week in Q4. It was no small feat.

Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work. As far as where we stand, in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of commissioning and install. Really, our 2023 goal as a 4680 team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck. Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible.

The introduction of Unison for leadership multi-device experience as we ramp the more than 60 design wins and the uniqueness of vPro in the enterprise market, helping our customers drive an almost 200% return on investment by deploying vPro platforms to their end users. Lastly, as consumer graphics reintegrate into CCG, enthusiasm for our latest Alchemist-based discrete graphics products continue to build and we expect volume ramp throughout the year. Turning to NEX and Mobileye. Both businesses have performed well in Q4 and calendar year '22, partially insulated by some of the market forces impacting PCs and server.

Any exit key product milestones with Mount Evans, Raptor Lake P&S, and Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapids to drive a second consecutive year of double-digit year-on-year growth in calendar year '22. We expect market share gains and outperformance to continue in '23. Mobileye increased revenue by almost 60% year on year in Q4 and is on a solid growth path for calendar year '23. Calendar year '22 design wins, including supervision, are projected to generate future revenue of approximately $6.7 billion across 64 million units.

In addition, our manufacturing organization performed well throughout calendar year '22. Starting the year, navigating the worst supply constrained environment in over 20 years, only to have to pivot in Q2 to respond to rapidly changing demand signals, which are now driving near-term underloading in our factory network. More importantly, we continue to push forward with the next phase of IDM 2.0 creating an internal foundry evolving our systems business practices and culture to establish a leadership cost structure. This new approach is already gaining momentum internally.

As a reminder, the internal foundry model will place our BUs in a similar economic footing as external IFS customers and will allow our manufacturing group and BUs to be more agile, make better decisions and uncover efficiency and cost savings. We have identified nine different subcategories for operational improvement that our teams will aggressively pursue. In addition to establishing better incentives, this new approach will provide transparency on our financial execution, allowing us to better benchmark ourselves against other foundries and drive to best-in-class performance. We'll also provide improved transparency to our owners as we expect to share full internal foundry P&L in calendar year '24.

Ultimately, allowing you to better judge how we are allocating your capital and creating value. We expect additional efficiencies as we implement our internal foundry model, which is a key element to accomplish our $8 billion to $10 billion of cost savings exiting 2025, as we outlined on our last call. I want to remind everyone that we are on a multiyear journey. We remain focused on the things that are within our control as we navigate short-term headwinds while executing to our long-term strategy.

While I remain sober that we have a long way to achieve our financial expectations, I am pleased with the transformation progress that we are making. I can tell you, in addition to obviously focusing on the day-to-day running of the company we continue to examine numerous additional value-creating initiatives for 2023 as we always do. We will update you as we move along on any we deem appropriate. Rest assured, we remain committed to creating value for our owners and to delivering the long-term strategic road map we laid out at the beginning of this journey, and we are confident in our ability to do so.

We will: one, deliver on five nodes in five years, achieving process performance parity in 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025 with Intel Lake 1A; two, execute on an aggressive Sapphire Rapids ramp introduced Emerald Rapids in second half '23 and Granite Rapids and CR4s in 2024; three, ramp Media Lake in second half '23 and PRQ Lunar Lake in 2024; and four, expand our IFS customer base to include large design wins on Intel 16, Intel 3 and 18A this year. We also need to improve our cost structure and drive operational efficiency. On this front, we will: one, return to profitability and deliver the benefits of our calendar year '23, '24 and '25 efforts to reduce costs and drive efficiencies; two, execute on our internal foundry P&L by 2024; and three, expand on the use of our smart capital strategy to leverage multiple pools of capital, including skips and chips in the U.S. and Europe to balance our long-term capacity aspirations with near-term realities.

2023-02-23T01:30:32Z

So I'll start and turn it over to Jensen to talk more because I believe this will be a great topic and discussion also at our GTC. Our plans in terms of software, we continue to see growth even in our Q4 results, we're making quite good progress in both working with our partners, onboarding more partners and increasing our software. You are correct. We've talked about our software revenues being in the hundreds of millions.

And we're getting even stronger each day as Q4 was probably a record level in terms of our software levels. But there's more to unpack in terms of there, and I'm going to turn it to Jensen.

Yeah. First of all, taking a step back, NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today. It starts from data processing to learning, training, to validations, to inference. And so this body of software is completely accelerated.

It runs in every cloud. It runs on-prem. And it supports every framework, every model that we know of, and it's accelerated everywhere. By using NVIDIA AI, your entire machine learning operations is more efficient, and it is more cost effective.

You save money by using accelerated software. Our announcement today of putting NVIDIA's infrastructure and have it be hosted from within the world's leading cloud service providers accelerates the enterprise's ability to utilize NVIDIA AI enterprise. It accelerates people's adoption of this machine-learning pipeline, which is not for the faint of heart. It is a very extensive body of software.

It is not deployed in enterprises broadly, but we believe that by hosting everything in the cloud, from the infrastructure through the operating system software, all the way through pretrained models, we can accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprises. And so we're excited about this new extended part of our business model. We really believe that it will accelerate the adoption of software.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.

Thank you. Just wanted to clarify, Colette, if you meant data center could grow on a year-on-year basis also in Q1? And then Jensen, my main question kind of relate to two small related ones. The computing intensity for generative AI, if it is very high, does it limit the market size to just a handful of hyperscalers? And on the other extreme, if the market gets very large, then doesn't it attract more competition for NVIDIA from cloud ASICs or other accelerator options that are out there in the market?

Thanks for the question. First, talking about our data center guidance that we provided for Q1. We do expect a sequential growth in terms of our data center, strong sequential growth. And we are also expecting a growth year over year for our data center.

We actually expect a great year. If our year-over-year growth in data center probably accelerated past Q1.

Large language models are called large because they are quite large. However, remember that we've accelerated and advanced AI processing by a million x over the last decade. Moore's Law, in its best days, would have delivered 100x in a decade. By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks and algorithms, and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster, a million times faster.

What would have taken a couple of months in the beginning, now it happens in about 10 days. And of course, you still need a large infrastructure. And even the large infrastructure, we're introducing Hopper, which, with its transformer engine, its new NVLink switches and its new InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second data rates, we're able to take another leap in the processing of large language models. And so I think the -- by putting NVIDIA's DGX supercomputers into the cloud with NVIDIA DGX cloud, we're going to democratize the access of this infrastructure, and with accelerated training capabilities, really make this technology and this capability quite accessible.

We obviously have a lot of big players that are going to look to pivot and bring those apps to the market. I also like the enterprise side, although there will need to be some consumer participation, AI is going to be expensive to adopt and I think the most likely first adopters will actually be the enterprise, which is another reason I like Microsoft. Microsoft has really strong relationships with the Fortune 500 and the Fortune 2000. I think that's going to be some early adopters because the goal of AI is to drive down costs and unfortunately, as you've probably heard, to reduce headcount, who's going to want that more than the Fortune 500? I like that about Microsoft where it lands with the consumer is probably harder for an investor to predict.

We've seen that with the metaverse, despite there being a lot of industrial applications for the metaverse, such as training autonomous systems. The consumers have pushed back. They're not necessarily wanting their kids living in the metaverse or themselves with headsets so I think consumers can always be a little harder to predict whereas enterprise with AI, to me, makes a lot of sense and so Microsoft is right there so I would look at it broader too not just with ChatGPT, super popular, but who's really going to propel AI/ML forward? I believe it will come from the enterprise.

"Interview With David Rolfe of Wedgewood Partners
2023-02-17T20:48:00Z

It seemed that everything that could go wrong for the company in 2022 did go wrong: A post-pandemic growth hangover, the multibillion revenue hit from Apple's (AAPL -1.80%) infamous iOS 14.5 update that introduced the company's App Tracking Transparency (ATT), a cyclical slowdown in online advertising spending, poor capital allocation timing of stock buybacks, and Zuckerberg's unchecked spending of billions on both new hirings and massive billions to be spent on artificial intelligence and the metaverse. Even renaming the company from Facebook to Meta Platforms seems premature. In short (from that long list), Zuckerberg has lost the confidence of shareholders. In the coin of the realm circa-2022/2023, Meta Platforms had lost ""the narrative"" -- despite its still intact family of apps profit and cash generation machinery.

We have long applauded companies that invest for the long term. Companies, regardless of their particular industry, must adapt, or evolve, or they will slowly die. That's why for years we have emphasized in our research the importance of capital allocation. This is critical to our investment process. We endeavor to hold our investments for many years, not just for a few quarters, which is the typical fare on Wall Street. Our portfolio of best-of-breed businesses generates substantial retained earnings. The deployment of this largesse into a myriad of capital allocation decisions (R&D, capex, M&A, stock buybacks) is arguably the most critical function of the C-suite.

We've owned Apple since 2005. Apple is a very different company than it was 15 years ago -- much different still from the company's founding in Steve Jobs parents' garage in 1975. At the time of our first purchase, the iPhone was little more than a twinkle in Steve Job' eyes. In fact, early on in those years, the iPad was slated to be launched before the iPhone.

In our view, Zuckerberg has built and navigated the company quite well as technology and user behavior has changed. He has built it. They have come. He continues to build. His ""vision thing"" has be good, too, considering his early critics on mobile, Stories, and Reels. The jury is still out on his megaspending on the metaverse -- no, check that -- the jury is in on this score. By Wall Street's reaction, Zuckerberg's metaverse vision and spending is a near-unanimous flop. We don't share this view. We remain bulls on Zuckerberg and Meta Platforms.

In fact, in the general internet economy, which is to say any enterprise or institution whereby the internet today is in any way relevant, expect future digital disruption. These countless entities are already planning for the next evolution of the internet (call it what you will). And they collectively are already planning for it in size -- whether Zuckerberg builds his vision of a metaverse platform or not.

The stock at 2022 lows had priced in zero growth in FoA users and little rebound in profitability. This is fat-pitch territory. Valuations at current levels need to assume a long secular decline in the company's family of apps business and continued billions dumped into the assumed metaverse landfill. Both extremes in the negative, in our view. If the combination of favorable 2023 catalysts emerge, along with unduly cheap valuations, we may well swing again at the shares. The stock has currently staged one of the most remarkable turnarounds I have witnessed since entering the investment business way back in 1986.

Rotonti: What is your thesis in Pool Corp. (POOL -1.18%)?

Rolfe: Those of you who own a backyard pool already know the Pool Corp. story quite well. (""Honey, why is the pool water green?"") Those who don't own a pool, well, we recommend a little rent-seeking on your neighbor's pool by owning these shares. The Pool Corp. strategy is beautifully simple: build a pool and become its customer for life. Once the major discretionary expenditure of building a pool is made, that high-maintenance asset becomes an annual annuity for your local pool service company. Increasingly, that local pool service company could well be owned by Pool Corp.

Our CCaaS business now represents approximately $300 million of ARR. Going forward, we will provide updates on our CCaaS ARR on a semiannual basis with the next update in Q2 '23. We have also set the foundation for expanding profitability. In 2022, our operating profit dollars rose over 50% year over year, which resulted in an operating profit margin of 12.4%, up 220 basis points year over year with more to come.

Now turning to our balance sheet. We ended 2022 with cash of $270 million. This is inclusive of $55 million of shares repurchased in Q4, bringing the full year total to approximately $100 million. Today, we are announcing a new board-approved share repurchase authorization for $175 million through December 31, 2023.

Moving to free cash flow. As is typical in our industry, timing differences between commissions and customer payments result in a delta between operating margin and free cash flow margin. Thus, our free cash flow margin over a 12-month period typically trails our non-GAAP operating margin by 5 to 6 points. These upfront commissions are investments that result in very attractive ROI over the life of the customer.

For the full year 2022, we generated free cash flow of $75 million or a margin of 4%. This includes a roughly 3-point impact from items related to restructuring, third-party relocation costs, renegotiating terms with vendors, and the linearity of vendor payments. Our disciplined approach to driving productivity and efficiency across the business will result in meaningful free cash flow expansion in 2023 and beyond. We are targeting robust free cash flow growth in '23 with normalized unlevered free cash flow doubling over the next two years, 2022 to 2024.

The free cash flow growth we project provides us with the flexibility to invest for growth, address our converts and return capital to our shareholders. On this point, I'm excited to announce that we have entered into a five-year, $600 million credit facility consisting of a $400 million delayed draw Term Loan A and a $200 million revolver with Bank of America and JPMorgan acting as joint lead arrangers and book runners and Wells Fargo as joint book runner. Use of proceeds from the revolver and Term Loan A are for general corporate purposes, including the retiring of convertible debt if market conditions present an attractive opportunity to do so. Term Loan A may be drawn at any time over the next nine months.

We saw very strong demand for the facility and had strong participation from leading financial institutions, which is a testament to our strengthening financial profile, strategy of driving efficient growth, robust free cash flow generation and focus on disciplined capital management. Now turning to guidance. This outlook is reflective of what we see in the market today. It does not assume any improvement to current macro conditions.

Taking this into account, for the first quarter of 2023, we expect subscriptions revenue growth of 14% to 15%; total revenue growth of 12% to 13%; non-GAAP operating margin of 16.5%; and non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 to $0.70. For the full year 2023, we expect subscriptions revenue growth of 10% to 11%; total revenue growth of 10% to 11%; non-GAAP operating profit margin of at least 18%, up at least 560 basis points versus last year. Based on the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we expect operating profit dollars to grow at least 60% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.04 to $3.10. As we look forward, we will be disciplined in protecting our ARPU while managing our cost structure as we drive durable growth and expanding operating profit margins.

Our operating margin improvement will be driven by four main factors. One, operating leverage as we continue to scale above $2 billion in recurring revenues. Two, more efficient labor spend and improving the productivity of our workforce. This includes stock-based compensation, which we expect to further improve as a percentage of revenue by more than 100 basis points year over year in 2023, following an almost 400-basis-point improvement in 2022.

2023-01-26T05:30:27Z

Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024.

Thank you. Next investor question is, Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck. Is that still the current plan? Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?

Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4. And to be clear, for 2023, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line, but it will be next year. So it's an incredible product. I can't wait to drive it personally.

It will be the car that I drive every day. I actually just -- I'm wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass. And it's just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it's really special. So yes, so with respect to upgrading cars on -- that have Hardware 3, I don't think that will be needed.

Hardware 3 will not be as good as Hardware 4, but I'm confident that Hardware 3 will so far exceed the average -- the safety of the average human. So [Inaudible] how do we get ultimately to -- let's say, for argument's sake, if Hardware 3 can be, say, 200% or 300% safer than human, Hardware 4 might be 500% or 600%. It will be Hardware 5 beyond that. But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road.

But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware 3 with Hardware 4 is quite significant. So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.

Thank you. The next question is for Zach. Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will become big enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in the financials of the business so investors can compare it to other insurance companies?

Yes. I think it's probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for specific financial disclosures. But I'm happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business. So we're currently at a $300 million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year.

We're growing 20% a quarter so it's growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business. And in the states in which we're operating, on average, 17% of the customers in the states are using a Tesla Insurance product. And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets. And we see most of the adoption occurring when folks take delivery of a new car, as they're setting up insurance for the first time as opposed to going back and switching when they already have insurance set up.

So there's an inherent stickiness in the Insurance business.

No, I was just going to say, just as a broader reminder on kind of the motivation for starting this business, it was to improve and still is to improve the total cost of ownership of our cars, given that we're seeing high premiums of insurance from third-party companies. And that remains our priority here. We'll obviously run this as a healthy business, but we want to make sure we keep our costs low and insurance stays affordable to our customers.

Yes. And so, there are two really important side benefit to our Tesla Insurance that are worth mentioning, one of which Zach alluded to, which is that just by Tesla operating insurance for our cars at a competitive rate, that makes the other car insurance companies offer better rates for Teslas. So it has a bigger effect than you think because it improves total cost -- or insurance costs even when they don't use Tesla Insurance, because now the gigas of the world have to compete with Tesla and cannot charge outrageous insurance for Teslas. So it's great.

So it has an amplified effect, very important. Then it is also giving us a good feedback loop into minimizing the cost of repair of Teslas for all Teslas worldwide, because we obviously want to minimize the cost of repairing a Tesla if it's in a collision and for Tesla Insurance. And previously, we didn't actually have good insight into that because the other insurance companies would cover the cost. And actually, the cost, in some cases, were unreasonably high.

Before I turn it over to Dave, I'm going to close by saying we take our commitments to all our stakeholders extremely seriously and ultimately, we strive to create value for each of them. For our customers, it is rebuilding our execution engine to provide a predictable cadence of best-in-class products to support their ambitions. For our employees is to provide them with the opportunity to develop and bring to market world-changing technologies. It is what inspires each of us inside of the company.

For our external owners is to make thoughtful, deliberate decisions around capital allocation, which drives the highest return on investment we make with your capital. Our ambitions are equal by our passion, and our efforts across manufacturing, design, products and foundry are well on their way to driving our transformation and creating the flywheel, which is IDM 2.0.

Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We saw solid business execution in the fourth quarter despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds impacting the semiconductor industry. As Pat indicated, we expect challenging macro conditions to continue through at least the first half of the year. As outlined last quarter, we'll continue to prioritize investments critical to our transformation, prudently and aggressively managed expenses near term and drive fundamental improvements in our cost structure longer term.

We're executing well toward our $3 billion target in 2023 and $8 billion to $10 billion exiting '25. Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, landing at the low end of our range and down 8% sequentially. Revenue from DCAI and NEX were in line with expectations, while CCG was impacted by softening demand for PCs. Gross margin for the quarter was 44%, slightly better than we had expected for the low end of our revenue range.

Q4 gross margins were impacted 220 basis points from factory underload charges offsetting a sequential 170 basis point benefit from an insurance settlement. EPS for the quarter was $0.10. $0.10 below our guide on lower revenue and increased inventory reserves. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $7.7 billion.

Net capex was $4.6 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of $3.1 billion and we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. We finished FY '22 with revenue of $63.1 billion, gross margin of 47.3% and EPS of $1.84. We generated $15.4 billion of cash from operations and an adjusted free cash flow of approximately negative $4 billion at the low end of the range we provided last quarter, despite approximately $3 billion of capital incentives that shifted from Q4 into 2023. When we spoke at investor day last February, we forecasted revenue of $76 billion and adjusted free cash flow of negative $1 billion to $2 billion for FY '22.

As macroeconomic conditions deteriorated at a rapid pace in second half of '22, we committed to optimizing the areas of the business within our control. Through reductions in spending and significant working capital improvements, we offset a $13 billion reduction to revenue expectations to come within $2 billion of our initial adjusted free cash flow guide, while still making the needed capital investments in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy, and to position ourselves for long-term growth in a market expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investment balances of more than $28 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade profile. Moving to fourth quarter business unit results.

CCG revenue was $6.6 billion, a decline of 36% year over year as PC TAM deteriorated faster than expected due to macroeconomic headwinds. Customer inventory remains elevated beyond our previous expectations and will continue to burn into the first half of '23. CCG realized record CPU ASPs, up 11% year over year as we continue to see relative strength in our premium segments driven by leadership performance and attractive features of our EVO and vPro platforms. Q4 operating profit was $0.7 billion, down year over year on lower revenue and increased Intel 7 product mix.

2023-02-23T01:30:32Z

So that's one thought. The second is the number of large language models or foundation models that have to be developed is quite large. Different countries with different cultures and its body of knowledge are different. Different fields, different domains, whether it's imaging or its biology or its physics, each one of them need their own domain of foundation models.

With large language models, of course, we now have a prior that could be used to accelerate the development of all these other fields, which is really quite exciting. The other thing to remember is that the number of companies in the world have their own proprietary data. The most valuable data in the world are proprietary. And they belong to the company.

It's inside their company. It will never leave the company. And that body of data will also be harnessed to train new AI models for the very first time. And so we -- our strategy and our goal is to put the DGX infrastructure in the cloud so that we can make this capability available to every enterprise, every company in the world who would like to create proprietary data and so -- proprietary models.

The second thing about competition. We've had competition for a long time. Our approach, our computing architecture, as you know, is quite different on several dimensions. Number one, it is universal, meaning you could use it for training, you can use it for inference, you can use it for models of all different types.

It supports every framework. It supports every cloud. It's everywhere. It's cloud to private cloud, cloud to on-prem.

It's all the way out to the edge. It could be an autonomous system. This one architecture allows developers to develop their AI models and deploy it everywhere. The second very large idea is that no AI in itself is an application.

There's a preprocessing part of it and a post-processing part of it to turn it into an application or service. Most people don't talk about the pre and post processing because it's maybe not as sexy and not as interesting. However, it turns out that preprocessing and post-processing oftentimes consumes half or two-thirds of the overall workload. And so by accelerating the entire end-to-end pipeline, from preprocessing, from data ingestion, data processing, all the way to the preprocessing all the way to post processing, we're able to accelerate the entire pipeline versus just accelerating half of the pipeline.

The limit to speed up, even if you're instantly passed if you only accelerate half of the workload, is twice as fast. Whereas if you accelerate the entire workload, you could accelerate the workload maybe 10, 20, 50 times faster, which is the reason why when you hear about NVIDIA accelerating applications, you routinely hear 10x, 20x, 50x speed up. And the reason for that is because we accelerate things end to end, not just the deep learning part of it, but using CUDA to accelerate everything from end to end. And so I think the universality of our computing -- accelerated computing platform, the fact that we're in every cloud, the fact that we're from cloud to edge, makes our architecture really quite accessible and very differentiated in this way.

And most importantly, to all the service providers, because of the utilization is so high, because you can use it to accelerate the end-to-end workload and get such a good throughput, our architecture is the lowest operating cost. It's not -- the comparison is not even close. So -- and yes, those are the two answers.

Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.

Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, you talked about ChatGPT as an inflection point kind of like the iPhone.

And so curious, part A, how have your conversations evolved post ChatGPT with hyperscale and large-scale enterprises? And then secondly, as you think about Hopper with the transformative engine and Grace with high-bandwidth memory, how have you kind of your outlook for growth for those two product cycles evolved in the last few months? Thanks so much.

"Interview With David Rolfe of Wedgewood Partners

Those who own older pools know quite well that pool maintenance is much more involved (read: expensive) than just annual chemicals in the early years. Once a pool reaches its early teen years (often sooner), maintenance reaches a very different level (read: expensive) when every part of the pool's filtration system wears out. As the years progress, the pool/backyard rebuild kicks off. Well, that original pool becomes a brand-new second pool. Rinse and repeat. Your local pool-service company is assuredly not the lonely Maytag repairman.

A decade or so ago, most backyard pools were simply pools surrounded by some type of hard coping. Fast-forward to today, and our backyards have turned into major entertainment centers. We are spending much more time outdoors, and the backyard is now a focal point of our homes. Healthier outdoor living is now ingrained in our lifestyles and budgets. According to Zillow (Z -2.65%) (ZG -2.57%) Research Surveys, respondents asked of the importance of a house with a pool (or spa) jumped to 35% in 2021, from 25% in just 2019. Pools are now surrounded by decking and patios, outdoor fireplaces and kitchens, majestic fireplaces and waterfalls, outdoor lighting, weatherproof speakers, hardscapes, landscapes, and irrigation -- much of it connected to apps controlled by smartphones. Indeed, significant technological advancements are found across the entire spectrum of a modern pool, dominated by automation; sanitizing systems (salt systems, UV systems, and ozone systems); heat pumps (which cool water, too); robotic cleaners; whisper-quiet, variable speed pumps, and LED lighting. Pool Corp. distributed all this backyard evolution.

Today, the company is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related outdoor living products, operating over 410 sales centers in 12 countries across North America, Europe, and Australia, and distributing more than 200,000 national brand and private-label products from over 2,200 vendors to roughly 120,000 wholesale customers.

Notable, too, is the company's November 2021 acquisition of Largo, Florida-based Porpoise Pool & Patio, including its main operating subsidiaries, Sun Wholesale Supply and Pinch A Penny. Sun Wholesale Supply is a wholesale distributor of swimming pool and outdoor-living products, including a key, state-of-the-art (chlorine) specialty chemical packaging operation, which until now only sold to Pinch A Penny franchisees. Pinch A Penny is the largest franchiser of pool and outdoor living-related specialty retail stores in the U.S., with approximately 260 independently owned and operated franchised stores in Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia, and brings Pool Corp. substantial opportunities for expansion.

Sixty percent of the company's business revolves around the installed base of pools (and spas). Pool renovations and upgrades are 20%, and new pool construction is 20%, as well. Its typical customer, 80%-plus, are local maintenance contractors and professional builders. Local backyard-related retailers make up 12% and the rest is a small mixture of do-it-yourself customers and commercial customers (hotels, theme parks, and universities).

The company estimates its U.S. share of the pool industry to be around 38% in the $10 billion wholesale market ($22 billion retail), based on the U.S. installed base of 5.4 million pools. The company is about four times larger than its only national competitor (Heritage Pool Supply, a division of SRS Distribution). Horizon (Green), the fourth-largest landscape distributor in the U.S., with 81 locations largely in the Sun Belt, services a $14 billion national Green addressable market.

Pool Corp. has been a growth and profitability powerhouse for years. The company reminds us of another powerhouse, Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL -1.66%). Both share a long-ingrained culture of organic growth by nonstop capacity additions. Both, too, have surely benefited by strategic acquisitions, but at the end of the day, the consistent ability to serve more customers from existing locations is the seed-corn of organic growth. Such growth, on top of the long crawl of operating leverage is the mother's milk of ever-increasing profitability.

We believe this trend will continue beyond '23, given: one, our discipline on labor also applies to stock-based compensation; and two, the impact of issuing shares at historical prices. We are committed to driving SBC as a percentage of revenue meaningfully lower over the next two years. Three, a multiyear go-to-market transformation to further improve sales and marketing productivity and partner economics, which will lower the cost of acquiring new customers. Four, vendor rationalization, which will drive meaningful procurement savings.

These levers are key as we drive toward continued significant margin expansion and growing free cash flow. In summary, 2022 was a year of solid execution despite a difficult macro backdrop. In 2023, we will deliver healthy growth and drive greater efficiency within the business. Two quarters ago, we reiterated our commitment to achieving at least a 20% operating margin.

Since then, we have hit major milestones in the path to achieving this goal. To this end, we are proud to announce that we expect to exit 2023 with at least a 20% operating profit margin. We have built a strong foundation and we remain laser-focused on delivering value to our stakeholders. With that, let's open the call for questions.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Hey, good evening, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe first one, Sonalee, for you. I appreciate the enhanced disclosures and all the detail around the leverage. I guess just when I think about capital management strategy overall, now that you have the facility to take care of the converts, how should we think about between the buyback and other ways of using the free cash flow, how should we think about using that over the next 12 months and then redeploying that? And is there room for that free cash flow conversion to improve now that some of the prepaid commissions that you previously had have a better structure with your partnerships?

Yeah. Thanks for the question, Samad. And yes, we are very, very excited about the credit facility that we announced today. So that's a $200 million term loan and $400 million -- $200 million revolver and $400 million Term Loan A.

And what I would say is our revenue and profitability profile that we outlined for you really allows us to consider accessing all forms of financing, so not just convertible debt markets. And we believe that the Term Loan A really provides us the best option to retire a portion of our convertible debt and reduce those maturities if market conditions present an attractive opportunity for us to do so. And I would say the terms were very attractive and demand for that transaction was very strong. We have no immediate plan to retire the converts, but we'll be watching the market closely and make a decision on whether to draw on that Term Loan A or not over the next nine months or so.

But within that, we plan to grow EBITDA significantly over the next few years. And that will drive down our leverage multiple significantly and again presents us with a lot of optionality in terms of how we refinance convertibles, how we decide to invest in our own organic growth, and then, as you say, share buybacks. So, I really view our capital allocation policy as dynamic. It will take all three forms.

But at the moment, we are, as you know, very firmly focused on driving margin improvement and also free cash flow. And in terms of the relationship between the two, you heard in my prepared remarks, we're expecting free cash flow to double over the period '22 to '24. However, you still will see about a 5-point delta between OP margin and free cash flow, as is the case and is typical with many SaaS businesses. In terms of the renegotiation of the partnership, that is helpful in terms of driving margin, but it wouldn't make a significant enough difference in terms of really narrowing that delta.

"Tesla (TSLA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript
2023-01-26T05:30:27Z

So we've actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the intelligence of full self-driving for active safety, active collision prevention. So it's giving us this really good feedback for, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just figuring out how to get -- if somebody's car is in an accident -- most accidents are actually small. They're like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents. But we're actually solving how to get somebody's car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands.

And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars. And we're making -- just to emphasize another key point because some of these points might be less, so I apologize for being repetitive. But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of spare part -- providing spare parts needed for collision repair have an enormous effect on the repair cost. So if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car.

It's extremely expensive. And of course, you're missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive. So this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.

Thank you. The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for midyear?

We do expect production to start, I don't know, maybe sometime this summer. But I always like try to downplay the start of production because the start of production is always very slow. It increases exponentially, but it's always very slow at first. So I wouldn't put too much thought in start of production.

It's kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that's next year.

Yes, that's right. Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of all the production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops. We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said, the ramp will really come 2024.

And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage, where should Tesla build the next Megapack factories? How many are needed on each continent?

It's a good question. It's not something we -- I think we'll provide an update about that in the future, but it is something we're thinking about very carefully. But really kind of like what is the fastest path to 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production. And you'll see announcements come out later this year and next that answer that question.

Thank you. OK. And now let's go to analyst questions. The first analyst question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.

I think I'm unmuted. Can you hear me?

Yes, we can.

OK. Thank you. Firstly, it sounds like your 1.8 million unit volume indication for this year is somewhat more supply constrained than demand-constrained. Then I have a follow-up on cost.

Is that an accurate statement?

Well -- OK. I mean, our internal production potential is actually closer to 2 million vehicles, but we were saying 1.8 million because, I don't know, there just always seems to be some freaking force majeure thing that happens somewhere on earth. And we don't control if there's like earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, pandemics, etc. So if it's a smooth year, actually, without some big supply chain interruption or massive problem, we actually have the potential to do 2 million cars this year.

We're not committing to that, but I'm just saying that's the potential. So -- and I think there would be demand for that, too.

Yes. And on the cost side, the numbers that we just saw from you, as you pointed out, were weighed down by the 4680 ramp, the Berlin, Austin, Giga things, processes, not at rate. Can you give us a bit of an indication of the headwind that you're absorbing from those things like you did last quarter? And then, lastly, on cost, do you think that we can tease out an interesting data point from -- on where battery costs are headed from this announcement that you just made last night? If I'm correct, it looks like the investment cost per kilowatt-hour is less than half of what I've seen anywhere else, maybe $30 a kilowatt-hour for that capacity.

DCAI revenue was $4.3 billion in Q4, up 2% sequentially with higher ASPs offsetting demand softness and down 33% year over year driven by TAM contraction and competitive pressure. DCAI operating profit for the fourth quarter was $371 million. While still under satisfactory, profit was up more than $350 million sequentially on reduced factory costs. Operating profit was down substantially year over year, impacted by lower revenue, increased advanced node start-up costs and higher product costs.

Within DCAI, PSG achieved record Q4 revenue, up 42% year over year, along with record full year revenue, up 29% year over year through increased ASPs, improved external supply and strength in the infrastructure segment. PSG enters 2023 with still significant unfulfilled backlog. NEX quarterly revenue was $2.1 billion, down 1% year over year as declining global GDP impacted the Edge business, offsetting growth in Xeon network CPUs and the ramp of our Mounts Evans infrastructure processing unit. Despite second half macro headwinds, NEX set another full year record revenue at $8.9 billion up 11% year over year and marking consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth.

Operating profit was $58 million in the fourth quarter, down on mix shift to lower-margin segments and higher factory start-up costs. AHG achieved record quarterly revenue of $247 million, up 34% sequentially and up one point year over year, supported by the launch of Sapphire Rapids HBM. Operating loss was $441 million, down $63 million sequentially, with inventory valuations negatively impacted by softer demand, especially for crypto processors. Mobileye delivered another record revenue quarter of $565 million, up 26% sequentially and growth of more than $200 million and 59% year over year.

Full year revenue of $1.9 billion was also a record for Mobileye growing 35% year over year. Fourth quarter operating income of $210 million represents 71% growth year over year. IFS achieved record quarterly revenue of $319 million, up 87% sequentially and 30% year over year on increased automotive shipments. Operating loss was $31 million, a $72 million improvement sequentially on higher revenue.

We continue to reshape the company to drive to world-class product costs and operational efficiency. We remain committed to the $3 billion of '23 cost savings outlined on our Q3 earnings call, while mindfully protecting the investments needed to accelerate our transformation and ensure we are well positioned for long-term market growth. Before turning to Q1 guidance, let me take a moment to discuss an accounting change that will impact our results beginning in the first quarter. Effective January 23, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from five years to eight years.

This change better reflects the demonstrated economic value of our machinery and equipment over time and is more aligned with the business model changes inherent to our IDM 2.0 strategy. The growth of the IFS deal pipeline will extend the life of manufacturing nodes beyond what was practical within IDM 1.0. Disaggregated CPU architecture allows performance and cost optimization for each chiplet better leveraging older nodes. And we are optimizing our core business around more sustainable capacity quarters to improve equipment utilization and maximize ROIC.

The change will be applied prospectively beginning Q1 '23. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of '22, we expect total depreciation expense in '23 to reduce by roughly $4.2 billion. An approximate $2.6 billion increase to gross profit, a $400 million decrease in R&D expense and a $1.2 billion decrease in ending inventory values. This change will not be counted toward the $3 billion short-term or $8 billion to $10 billion long-term structural cost improvements we committed last quarter, and is intended to provide the most accurate reflection of company financial results to our owners.

Now, turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect first quarter revenue of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. In addition to continued macro headwinds, we expect customers will burn inventory at a meaningfully faster pace than the prior few quarters in response to macro TAM softness impacting CCG, PCAI and the lines of business. We see potential for market conditions to improve faster than typical seasonality as third-party data shows macro headwinds easing in the second half of the year.

ChatGPT is a wonderful piece of work, and the team did a great job, OpenAI did a great job with it. They stuck with it. And the accumulation of all of the breakthroughs led to a service with a model inside that surprised everybody with its versatility and its capability. What people were surprised by, and this is in our -- and close within the industry is well understood.

But the surprising capability of a single AI model that can perform tasks and skills that it was never trained to do. And for this language model to not just speak English, or can translate, of course, but not just speak human language, it can be prompted in human language, but output Python, output Cobalt, a language that very few people even remember, output Python for Blender, a 3D program. So it's a program that writes a program for another program. We now realize -- the world now realizes that maybe human language is a perfectly good computer programming language, and that we've democratized computer programming for everyone, almost anyone who could explain in human language a particular task to be performed.

This new computer -- when I say new era of computing, this new computing platform, this new computer could take whatever your prompt is, whatever your human-explained request is, and translate it to a sequence of instructions that you process it directly, or it waits for you to decide whether you want to process it or not. And so this type of computer is utterly revolutionary in its application because it's democratized programming to so many people really has excited enterprises all over the world. Every single CSP, every single Internet service provider, and they're, frankly, every single software company, because of what I just explained, that this is an AI model that can write a program for any program. Because of that reason, everybody who develops software is either alerted or shocked into alert or actively working on something that is like ChatGPT to be integrated into their application or integrated into their service.

And so this is, as you can imagine, utterly worldwide. The activity around the AI infrastructure that we build Hopper and the activity around inferencing using Hopper and Ampere to inference large language models, has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there's no question that whatever our views are of this year as we enter the year has been fairly, dramatically changed as a result of the last 60, 90 days.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Jensen, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the DGX Cloud. And I guess, we're all talking about the drivers of the services and the compute that you're going to host on top of these services with the different hyperscalers.

But I think we've been kind of watching and wondering when your data center business might transition to more of a systems level business, meaning pairing and D-Link InfiniBand with your Hopper product, with your Grace product, and selling things more on a systems level. I wonder if you could step back, over the next two or three years, how do you think the mix of business in your data center segment evolves from maybe selling cards to systems and software? And what can that mean for the margins of that business over time? Thank you.

Yeah. I appreciate the question. First of all, as you know, our data center business is a GPU business only in the context of a conceptual GPU because what we actually sell to the cloud service providers is a panel, a fairly large computing panel of eight Hoppers or eight Amperes that's connected with NVLink switches that are connected with NVLink. And so this board represents essentially one GPU.

It's eight chips connected together into one GPU with a very high-speed chip-to-chip interconnect. And so we've been working on, if you will, multi-die computers for quite some time. And that is one GPU. So when we think about a GPU, we actually think about an HGX GPU, and that's 8 GPUs.

"Interview With David Rolfe of Wedgewood Partners
2023-02-17T20:48:00Z

While 2023 has started quite well for the company, our growth expectations for late-2022/early 2023 encompass a material decline in 2020-2021 growth rates. Namely, for calendar double-digit growth in revenues and low 20%-plus growth in earnings per share -- and back to high-single-digit growth in each during 2023. The current bear market has corrected the once-excessive valuation in the stock.

Rotonti: What do you like about Edwards Lifesciences (EW -1.71%)?

Rolfe: Edwards Lifesciences has been in portfolios since 2017. The company is a leader in treating structural heart diseases and providing critical care technologies to surgical and intensive care centers. Edwards' flagship franchise is its Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) SAPIEN family of aortic heart valves. The company's TAVR products began revolutionizing aortic valve replacement clinics around 15 years ago. Prior to TAVR, patients who were too sick to undergo open-heart surgery often went untreated. After a long history of surgical valve development, Edwards came to develop a prosthetic aortic valve that could be inserted into place with a minimally invasive procedure, often via a small opening in the femoral artery (or less frequently, through a small incision in the ribs). Since then, Edwards has provided these life-saving valves for over 800,000 patients.

Edwards' revenue rose over 40%-plus from 2016 through 2021 driven by TAVR revenues that more than doubled. More recently, the company's TAVR performance has been volatile, especially when compared to the pre-pandemic trend line. The large swings in growth have been due to random regional shutdowns from the pandemic in addition to hospital staffing shortages. The pandemic societal shutdowns are almost impossible to predict, but we assume those will eventually subside, as they have in the U.S.

On the latter point of hospital staffing shortages, it is most acute in the U.S. Even though TAVR is minimally invasive to the body of the patient, it seems TAVR is ""moderately invasive"" to the administrative efforts of hospitals in the U.S., at least in the early part of this post-pandemic world. We will admit, surprisingly, that cracking open a patient's ribs in to expose their beating heart for an aortic valve replacement is more streamlined from an administrative perspective than minimally invasive TAVR. TAVR, on the other hand, requires several non-invasive, pre-operational steps in order to make a clinically safe decision about if and how the body can handle the procedure.

But Edwards, and the rest of the structural heart technology industry, have an excellent incentive to help hospitals alleviate the administrative bottleneck that emerged during the pandemic. We estimate Edwards' addressable market for TAVR grows by about $1 billion per year in the U.S. alone, based on demographics and compared to the company's 2021 TAVR revenues that approached $3.5 billion. Severe aortic stenosis (SAS), which is the disease that TAVR is most often used to treat, is most prevalent in those approaching their mid-70s and beyond. Only 12 out of 100 patients with SAS have had valve replacement therapy, with over 1 million patients estimated to be in need of the therapy in the U.S. alone. We estimate U.S. valves to cost anywhere from $20k to $30k per device. Further, Edwards is enrolling a study to treat patients with moderate aortic stenosis (MAS). MAS has been shown to be nearly as lethal as ""severe"" cases, but with a population that is twice the size.

The good news about Edwards' treatable population is they are living longer, not only once they reach 70 years of age but also once they reach 80 years and beyond. As people are living longer, they are more susceptible to moderate and severe forms of aortic stenosis. So there's no shortage of patients in need of TAVR treatment. Given the recent bottlenecks in the U.S. healthcare system, those calls for gloom and doom are coming again. But as we can see, the untreated population for both severe and moderate aortic stenosis is clearly huge and underserved, so TAVR's demise continues to be greatly exaggerated.

2023-02-16T05:00:24Z

So, for now, I would say for modeling purposes, expect that delta to continue between OP margin and free cash flow. Hopefully, that answers your question.

It does. And then I have a follow-up and this could really be for any of you all. But just as I think about where ARR ended and then the guidance for 2023 for -- it kind of suggests that subscription revenue in '23 will end up being about where ARR ended in 2022. I'm just curious, how should we think about that.

Is there an expected uptick in churn in the base? Or is there a combination of maybe expected churn versus some offset in slower new business? Just how do we reconcile where the business ended in the fourth quarter and then that forward subscription revenue? And it doesn't have to be on the math itself, but just maybe how is the company thinking about the business between those two different things?

Yeah. So why don't I start and then I may hand over to Mo for some comments around the business? We don't typically guide to ARR, but let me provide some color given your question. So, we are adding net new bookings at a healthy rate and we will in 2023. We've shown you a revenue guide of 10% to 11% for 2023 and that does factor in new bookings.

And what I would say directionally is we would expect ARR growth for '23 to be above where we guided for total revenue growth in '23. And some of the puts and takes there are as we are now growing more upmarket and also given the current macro, we've assumed more back-end-loaded bookings. And we're being more conservative in terms of what we're forecasting on churn and downsell in the current environment as is prudent. And as our base gets larger, obviously, that churn number, even if it's stable as a percentage, it gets larger as well.

But I think the most important thing from your perspective is that ARR growth, we would expect it directionally to be above total revenue growth for the year.

Really helpful. I'll hop back in the queue, but great to see all the progress on the margin expansion. Thanks, guys.

The next question is from Sterling Auty with SVB. Please go ahead.

Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I wanted to ask two questions on the extension with Avaya.

The first one is opening up the ability for them to sell direct or kind of in a wholesale method, how does that impact the amount of revenue per seat that you get which I would imagine gets diminished? But on the flip side, can you talk about the benefit that I imagine you get at the operating margin contribution level?

Thanks for the question. Yes, we're very excited about the new agreement with Avaya. We expect them, as part of their recapitalization, to emerge stronger and be focused on selling Avaya Cloud Office as one of their key offerings into the market. As you say, one of the key reasons why we're excited is because, one, we now have minimum seat commitments as part of the arrangement; and two, as we think about the product work we're doing and the new go-to-market motions that we're introducing, including their ability to sell direct, there's a lot more incentive for them to actively go look at their existing, the world's largest base of on-premise seats, and move them to the cloud.

Relative to the economics, we expect that the economics of them selling direct is actually accretive to the current economics that we're getting from them. And then it simply becomes a function of what volumes we should be expecting, minimum commits or potentially something larger, in the coming quarters and years. So, hopefully, that answers your question.

It does. Just one follow-up would be, is that accretion at the revenue line, the EBIT line, or both? And on the guaranteed minimums, it's a company that's coming through a packaged bankruptcy, what's kind of the, I guess, the handcuffs or the feet to the fire that get those minimums paid?

Great question. So, what I'd tell you is, yes, for sure, on the EBIT/contribution margin side, it's very much accretive. As you think about revenue, it really becomes a function of the volumes that are sold. In a direct motion, yes, there is less top line.

I don't think we want to say the specific number, but it's interesting, if you look at the size of the -- of Giga Nevada that is allocated to make 100 gigawatt-hours, is a small fraction of the size that currently makes about 35.

Yes. I mean, the goals we've outlaid at Battery Day on using the investment required to deploy cell manufacturing, I mean, that's been a key focus of ours, and the team is doing a good job hitting the marks on that focus.

Yes. And it goes back to the point I was making. I said it several years ago, I think Tesla's really the competitive strength that will be, by far, the hardest for other companies to replicate is Tesla being just d*** good at manufacturing and having the most advanced manufacturing technology in the world. And if you've got that sort of advanced manufacturing toolbox, you can apply it to many things and we're applying it now to battery cells.

I should also say that there -- we have other products in development. We're not going to announce them, obviously, but they're very exciting. And I think it will blow people's minds when they -- when we reveal them. Tesla has the most exciting product road map of any company on earth by a long shot.

And we'll continue to, I think, be in that position. We've got more great ideas. I mean, we know what to do here. So the future is very exciting.

As I said in the last call, there's going to be bumps along the way and we'll probably have a pretty difficult recession this year, probably. I hope not, but probably. And so, one can't predict the short-term sort of stock value because when there's a recession and people panic in the stock market, then prices of stocks -- well, the value of stocks can drop sometimes to surprisingly low levels. But long term, I am convinced that Tesla will be the most valuable company on earth.

Thank you. And I think, Zach, there was a question on cost headwind in Q4.

Yes. I mean, our weighted average COGS for the company, if you were to assume Austin and Berlin were at the cost structure of our other factories, it was on the order of 2,000 to 2,500 of headwinds. So I think from there, you can back into margin impact of those factories as of end of Q4.

Thank you very much. And let's go to the next question from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Pierre, please go ahead.

Thanks, Martin. Can you hear me well?

Excellent. Zach, actually, I'd like to follow up on the data point you just gave on cost. If I look back at the COGS per car, you guys bottom close to $36,000 in the middle of 2021. And then, the number went up as you had to face with inflation in input costs and the ramp of Berlin and Texas.

And this quarter, I think we are close to $40,000 and we peaked maybe close to $42,000 at some point last year. And so, my question from here is, how much time do you think it takes you to get back to this kind of $36,000, which would mean Berlin and Texas? And I think input cost, all that stuff is normalizing, is that like -- and that would be like a kind of like a 10% decline in the COGS per car. Is that something we can hope to see this year or is that too optimistic?

The Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies in 4680 will make a substantial amount of progress on that over the course of the year, and that's within Tesla's control. We're doing a lot of work on cost reduction outside of that. And we talked about supply chain costs, expedites, logistics, attacking everything. On the raw materials and inflation side, where lithium is the large driver there and this was a meaningful source of cost increase for us, we'll have to see where lithium prices go.

And we're not fully exposed to lithium prices, but I think in general, as what we've seen from our forecast here, cost per car of lithium in 2023 will be higher than 2022. So that's a headwind that would have to be overcome to return back to those levels. So I don't think we'll get there this year, but I think we'll make progress. And we'll continue to find ways to offset these raw material costs that we don't have control over.

While we're progressing toward a $3 billion spending reduction with significant austerity across the company, given the fixed cost nature of our business, we expect the sequential revenue decline will result in negative operating margin in the first quarter. We're forecasting gross margin of 39%, a tax rate of 13% and EPS of negative $0.15 at the midpoint of revenue guidance, inclusive of $350 million to $500 million of operating margin benefit from the useful life accounting change, split approximately 75% to cost of sales and 25% to opex. Factory underload charges are projected to impact Q1 gross margin by 400 basis points. We continue to evaluate all investments and will remain laser-focused on optimizing for ROI, adjusting for market conditions across operating expenses and capital assets.

While we're not providing guidance beyond Q1, I'll touch on a few elements of our outlook. At investor day, we noted that during the investment phase of IDM 2.0 from 2022 through 2024, our model was to operate at approximately 35% net capital intensity. For FY '23, despite the lower revenue level, we expect to be at or below the 35% model. Embedded in our assumptions are capital offsets of around 20% to 30% of growth capex including our innovative Skip partnership with Brookfield.

We expect FY '23 operating expenses of under $20 billion, a roughly 10% year-over-year decline, consistent with committed cost-cutting measures totaling $2 billion, adjusting for the depreciation change. Adjusted free cash flow will be below our investor day guide of approximately neutral in the first half of '23 and return back toward guardrails in second half '23. In closing, we remain committed to the strategy and long-term financial model we laid out at investor day last year. The opportunity for strong revenue growth across our business unit portfolio and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains.

While we're not satisfied with near-term results, this market downturn represents an opportunity to accelerate the transformation necessary to achieve our long-term goals. I look forward to providing updates on our transformation journey as the year progresses. With that, let me turn the call back over to John.

Thank you, Dave. We will now move into the Q&A portion of our call. [Operator instructions] With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first caller.

[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.

Hi, guys. Thanks. Let me ask a question. I guess, Dave, to hit on some of the revenue questions or items you just said, do you expect the first quarter to be the bottom in absolute dollars through the year? And any color between the segments? It seems like it's exceedingly a CCG problem right now in the quarter? Or is it broader than that?

Yes. So you want to go first? OK. So let me -- I'll start, and Pat is going to add some color. So on the $11 billion, we're expecting most of the business units to be down sequentially, double digits.

We're not going to provide guidance for the rest of the year. But I did say that the first half is likely to be seeing these inventory corrections. The other thing I would just add is maybe color to kind of position the year is that we're expecting Q1 to be the most significant inventory decline at our customers that we've seen in recent history. So it's -- if you look back over the last four or five quarters of reduction, this will be meaningfully higher than all of those quarters.

So obviously, that is impacting the Q1 outlook.

Yes. And clearly, as we look at Q1, affected by macro significant inventory adjustments, and that's affecting clearly clients but also data center as well. And we do see that year on year, quarter on quarter data center to be down as well. And we think that's a macro statement across all segments across cloud, enterprise, government and uniquely China.

Part of our more positive expectation for the second half of the year is clearly from our customers and what we've heard from them but also with expected some level of recovery from China as well. So overall, clearly, a major inventory correction cycle and coming after back-to-school and how do they refresh our customers clearly wanting to take more aggressive steps as they adjust. But that inventory adjustment is well below their sell-out rates. So for that, we do believe that we will see recovery as they have made those inventory adjustments, and we'll see the business be stronger as we go through the year.

We're going to continue to do that. And the thing that the cloud service providers are really excited about is by hosting our infrastructure for NVIDIA to offer because we have so many companies that we work directly with. We're working directly with 10,000 AI start-ups around the world, with enterprises in every industry. And all of those relationships today would really love to be able to deploy both into the cloud at least or into the cloud and on-prem and oftentimes multi-cloud.

And so by having NVIDIA DGX and NVIDIA's infrastructure are full stack in their cloud, we're effectively attracting customers to the CSPs. This is a very, very exciting model for them. And they welcomed us with open arms. And we're going to be the best AI salespeople for the world's clouds.

And for the customers, they now have an instantaneous infrastructure that is the most advanced. They have a team of people who are extremely good from the infrastructure to the acceleration software, the NVIDIA AI open operating system, all the way up to AI models. Within one entity, they have access to expertise across that entire span. And so this is a great model for customers.

It's a great model for CSPs. And it's a great model for us. It lets us really run like the wind. As much as we will continue and continue to advance DGX AI supercomputers, it does take time to build AI supercomputers on-prem.

It's hard no matter how you look at it. It takes time no matter how you look at it. And so now we have the ability to really prefetch a lot of that and get customers up and running as fast as possible.

Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.

Thanks a lot. Jensen, I had a question about what this all does to your TAM. Most of the focus right now is on text, but obviously, there are companies doing a lot of training on video and music. They're working on models there.

And it seems like somebody who's training these big models has maybe, on the high end, at least 10,000 GPUs in the cloud that they've contracted and maybe tens of thousands of more to inference a widely deployed model. So it seems like the incremental TAM is easily in the several hundred thousands of GPUs and easily in the tens of billions of dollars. But I'm kind of wondering what this does to the TAM numbers you gave last year. I think you said $300 billion hardware TAM and $300 billion software TAM.

So how do you kind of think about what the new TAM would be? Thanks.

I think those numbers are really good anchor still. The difference is because of the, if you will, incredible capabilities and versatility of generative AI and all of the converging breakthroughs that happened toward the middle and the end of last year, we're probably going to arrive at that TAM sooner than later. There's no question that this is a very big moment for the computer industry. Every single platform change, every inflection point in the way that people develop computers happened because it was easier to use, easier to program and more accessible.

This happened with the PC revolution. This happened with the Internet revolution. This happened with mobile cloud. Remember, mobile cloud, because of the iPhone and the App Store, 5 million applications and counting emerged.

There weren't 5 million mainframe applications. There weren't 5 million workstation applications. There weren't 5 million PC applications. And because it was so easy to develop and deploy amazing applica

We expect Edwards to be able to compound revenues at a double-digit rate over the next several years by driving higher adoption of TAVR, as well as through the launch of new platforms targeting other forms of structural heart disease (especially related to mitral valve). The company probably ""under-earns"" as they commit between 15%-20% of revenues to R&D, a multiple of larger medtech conglomerates (e.g., Medtronic (MDT -0.59%), Abbott Laboratories (ABT -2.04%), and Stryker (SYK -0.40%). Edwards' returns are still tremendous, even with this high level of reinvestment in future growth.

Rotonti: What is your thesis in First Republic Bank (FRC -2.26%)?

Rolfe: First Republic Bank is one of the most differentiated business models in our large-cap universe. What makes the company so different is not necessarily the activities that it does, but the activities it does not do. These trade-offs are an incredibly important strategic decision that every company must make. However, in our experience, rarely are these forgone activities lauded or even recognized as critical differentiators.

When we consider the financial industry, especially banking, is fraught with competition, simply being better than any of the other massive money-center banks is not enough to sustain many decades or even years of superior performance. Rather than try to outcompete every bank in the country, First Republic's competitive strategy of doing only a handful of things well results in a superior value proposition to its customers. These trade-offs are easy to understand, but difficult to copy, given widespread competitive and institutional imperatives that pressure management teams to revert to the mean.

First Republic organizes its entire business around keeping long-term relationships with its bankers and clients. This strategic decision contrasts with competitors that have underlying strategic goals to drive as much client activity as possible. As a result, client development activities at First Republic look very different from those of its competitors. First Republic has outgrown its peers over the past several years. The company compounded revenues at an 18%-plus rate from 2016 to 2021 and is now one of largest single-family mortgage lenders in the U.S.

And more recently, the dramatic rise in long-term interest rates has caused mortgage industry underwriting volumes to plummet, mostly due to a decline in refinance activity. Despite this, and admittedly to our surprise, First Republic turned in an astonishing 23%-plus growth rate in mortgage originations during the second quarter of 2022. That is not to say things won't slow from here, given the continued rise in rates, but it was another important, contrasting data point of how the company's busines

But to the degree that they have the world's largest base and are able to actively monetize that base, then it could certainly be accretive on the top line as well. And then to the final piece of your question, we're comfortable that the contractual provisions that we have in place will allow us to achieve the minimum commitment volumes. And to the degree that we're not able to achieve those, then there's mechanisms in place to address that as well.

The next question is from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Hi. Very nice to see all the operational improvements. It looks like you're getting super razor-focused on all kinds of levers, top line, expenses, etc. Good to see that.

Vlad, one for you on AWS, maybe Mo, the two of you, whoever wants to talk about it. What are the specific segments of the market that you think you can address with this AWS partnership that you could previously not address? And how does this work? Will AWS salespeople get compensated? Will there be commission sharing between the two organizations? And how are you going to be uncovering the lead pipeline with respect to generating this business? And as a follow-up, as a result of that, how much of the AWS partnership is in your guidance? Because if I do some rough math, I look at the net new subscription implied by your guidance, it's a decline of about 40%, 50%, which I guess is consistent with how the fourth quarter panned out. But are you really seeing new business activity in the months of January and February following that trend? Or things are looking a little bit better, but you don't want to get ahead of yourself? Thank you so much.

Kash, Vlad here. Yeah. No, thanks for the compliment here. Let me take the first part of the first question, please.

Look, so it's obviously early with AWS. We just announced. But it seems for now that it will be skewing more upmarket, more enterprise. This is where their sales forces are most active anyway.

I can tell you that we're already seeing good deal flow. Obviously, the deal has been in the works for quite some time and the companies have already begun working together. We noted, I think, in our prepared remarks that our entire portfolio will also be available in their Marketplace. So, we expect for this to be more inclusive.

But as far as the direct sales efforts, again, I would see more upmarket concentration. And Mo, maybe you can take the second part of the question.

Yeah. Absolutely. So Kash, just to build on that. Yes, we're very excited about the AWS opportunity.

Considering how new it is, that is not currently in our guidance, A; B, what's really something that has gotten us interested in this one is that, too, their sellers will be compensated and be able to retire quota by selling our unified communications as a service product. And then there is no commissions back to them, if you will, which was a part of your question. Then I think the final thing that you asked was what are we seeing in terms of so far in 1Q and the trends that we're seeing in 1Q are consistent with what we saw in 4Q overall. So, Kash, I believe we answered your multifaceted question.

But if there's anything we missed, please let us know.

The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

[Inaudible], is there anything on that?

Yes. Like on the non-cells raw material, we begin to capture benefits of indexes tapering out, but due to the length of various supply chains, it does take time before this is reflected in our financials. And while aluminum is down like 20% year over year, steel is about 30% down year over year, the global non-cells raw materials market continues to be influenced by geopolitical situations in Europe, high production cost due to labor cost increases and energy spikes and disruptions due to natural disasters like typhoon in Korea four months ago, pandemic lockdowns. So we believe that meaningful price corrections will ultimately come, but it remains uncertain exactly when.

In the meantime, we continue to redesign supply chain to make it more efficient and work with our supplier partners to find more efficiencies, streamline logistics and transportation to produce cars.

Sorry, do you want to go say something?

I was going to say, we're also -- our fleet is starting to mature, the 3, Y fleet. And we're gathering a lot of data out of that fleet to understand how we can sort of bring some margin that we didn't know we had out of the product. So over the course of 2023, on the powertrain side, we're actually going to go after sort of some materials where we're paying for more performance than we need or we have more content than we need without impacting reliability at all. And that will actually add up to a pretty significant cost reduction on the powertrain side over the course of 2023.

So we're not just sort of relying on supply. We're also doing design actions to bring cost out.

My guess is if the recession is a serious one, and I think it probably will be but I hope it isn't, that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs. So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin. I'm just guessing here. So this is -- that would be my guess.

Excellent. Thank you so much. So as a quick follow-up, Elon, I was thinking about like FSD, and when you look at like the situation today compared to a year ago, it's -- like the progress has been like amazing in the quality of the product but also its rollout. And so, I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the take rate of FSD today? So do you already see that people are getting more excited by FSD because they see it around them on 400,000 cars and they see the value of the service already? Or is that too early to really see like -- to expect like an uptick in the take rate?

The trend is very strong toward use of FSD. And as you alluded to, the -- with each incremental improvement, the enthusiasm obviously increases. And so, I think something that still a lot of people out there don't quite appreciate is that Tesla -- of course, Tesla is as much as a software company as a hardware company, but Tesla is really one of the world's leading AI

Ross, do you have a follow-up?

I do. quickly, Dave, I want to pivot to the gross margin side of things, excluding the change in the depreciable life side of the equation, I know revenue is the biggest headwind right now. But you had talked at the investor day last year about a 51% to 53% gross margin range and kind of you want to operate within those bands. What does it take to get back to that? Is there a revenue level? Do you have to be above $17 billion, $18 billion? Are there offsets any sort of framework you can give to give investors confidence that we never thought we'd see a three handle on your gross margin.

And so, we really want to know what it's going to take to get back to a five handle. And if that's significantly changed from the last framework that you provided us?

Yes, good question. So obviously, revenue is the most significant impact to gross margins. We obviously did not expect to be down at these levels. That said, it's a function of some significant inventory burn.

So it's not necessarily a reflection of the demand in the market. So obviously, we would expect that to ever at some point, which will be a significant lift to the gross margins. The other thing is, in the first quarter, we're going to have about a 400 basis point impact on our gross margins just from underloading because of the demand softness. And we would expect loadings to improve once we get past the inventory correction we're currently experiencing.

In addition to that, we have a number of initiatives underway to improve gross margins, and we're well underway. When you look at the $3 billion reduction that we talked about for '23, $1 billion of that is in cost of sales, and we're well underway on our way to getting that $1 billion.
