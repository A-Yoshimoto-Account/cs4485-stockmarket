Why Super Micro Computer Gained 35.4% in February,null,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreShares of server company Super Micro Computer (SMCI 0.21%) rose 35.4% in February, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.Super Micro stock was the rare 2022 winner in the tech space, nearly doubling in a year when the Nasdaq fell over 30%. In January, the stock became the target of a short report from activist short-seller Spruce Point Capital, which caused the stock to sell off as investors booked gains and shorts piled in.However, Super Micro reported solid results on Jan. 31 after market close, and the stock regained its footing through February. Moreover, Super Micro is a close partner of Nvidia, which reported better-than-expected results and gave a positive outlook on artificial intelligence (AI) server demand.In its second fiscal quarter ending in December, Super Micro reported 53.8% revenue growth to $1.8 billion, beating expectations by $20 million, with non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $3.26, beating expectations by $0.23. That's certainly eye-popping growth, and defies a lot of other technology hardware companies showing revenue declines. The outperformance can likely be attributed to Super Micro's energy-efficient and customizable server designs, which are finding favor among companies investing in AI and 5G capabilities, especially in an age of electricity price volatility.Of note, Super Micro did guide for a sequential decline in the quarter ahead; however, the March quarter is usually a seasonally lower quarter. Moreover, CEO Charles Liang said he expects mid-30% growth for fiscal 2023 ending in June. Even more encouraging and maybe surprising, Liang also said he expects 20% growth in fiscal 2024. How does Super Micro plan to defy the tough economy? Given that Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia all have brand-new advanced chips that just hit the market, Liang believes that will sustain Super Micro's sales growth, despite the economic slowdown.Super Micro also has a close relationship with Nvidia. On Nvidia's Feb. 22 earnings conference call, CEO Jensen Huang had positive things to say about its data center business, claiming the advent of ChatGPT and generative AI had ""brought AI to an inflection point."" Nvidia CFO Colette Kress added she expects Nvidia's data center revenue to accelerate throughout the year.That also bodes well for Super Micro, which sells AI servers powered by Nvidia GPUs. On SMCI's conference call, management pointed to AI/GPU platforms showing strong outperformance, exceeding 20% of revenue and calling AI/GPU servers a ""significant opportunity.""Super Micro Computer is a server assembler, which doesn't seem like that great of a business. However, its close co-development relationships with Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, as well as its focus on energy-efficient server system design is certainly ""serving"" it well these days. Moreover, even after the stock's massive run, it only trades at a 9 P/E multiple. All in all, Super Micro still looks like the value investor's way to play the AI megatrend. Billy Duberstein has positions in Super Micro Computer and has the following options: short May 2023 $135 calls on Super Micro Computer and short May 2023 $140 calls on Super Micro Computer. His clients may own shares of the companies mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Nvidia.

  As chip sales dry up, Nvidia CFO says spending on AI will save companies money
",,"Nvidia Corp.’s financial chief reasons that the efficiencies businesses need are not from spending less money, but from spending more on technologies like artificial intelligence, even as chip sales dry up. “AI is in an inflection point,” Nvidia’s

       Colette Kress told Morgan Stanley’s Technology Media and Telecom Conference on Monday. “We’ve now incurred a point in time with generative AI, in particular with [OpenAI’s] ChatGPT, that folks understand, and just some of the most simple cases how this can benefit them — benefit them from a use case as a consumer, or an enterprise on thinking about how they can develop AI within their universe as well.”In that vein, Kress made the pitch that tightening the belt was not always the best way to save money, seeing that the recent jump in interest in ChatGPT taxed many public servers’ capacity.“When you think about these economic times, it’s both a time for folks to focus on their budgets or focus on what they’re spending on,” Kress said. “However, they’re still working on efficiencies of how they’re using their money, how they’re using their capital.”“The focus on accelerated computing, no matter how you look at it, is always going to be an improvement of efficiency and the use of their money,” Kress said. “The amount of money that they save in terms of moving to accelerated, not only is it more efficient just from a computing standpoint, but you’re spending less.”Read: Nvidia adds to AI hype with new cloud-based service, stock jumps on forecastBut customers are already spending less. The Semiconductor Industry Association said Friday that global chip-industry sales for January fell 18.5% to $41.3 billion from a year ago and 5.2% from December 2022’s $43.6 billion.“Despite record-high sales in 2022, the global semiconductor market cooled considerably during the second half of the year, and that trend continued during the first month of 2023,” said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO. “Despite the current short-term cyclical downturn, the long-term outlook for the semiconductor market remains strong due to the ever-increasing role of chips in powering the critical technologies of today and tomorrow.”Looking at SIA data, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon noted that month-over-month data was worse than typical seasonality and that memory-chip sales — those from companies like Micron Technology Inc.

        -2.23%
       — fell 58.6% year-over-year.For Nvidia, “opportunities around data center, software and auto remain early, and large,” Rasgon said, even with gaming headwinds and near-term China sentiment; Broadcom “has a good narrative & margin of safety with semi revenue visibility, software offering support, cash deployment, superb margins & [free cash flow], & attractive valuation;” and Qualcomm struggles against “a weak market and channel flush … impacting near-term trajectory, but the shares remain very inexpensive and setup into 2024 looks good as things normalize and Apple Inc.

  Tech execs didn’t just start talking about AI — but they are talking about it a lot more
",,"Do you feel like you’ve been hearing a lot more about artificial intelligence in 2023? A MarketWatch analysis shows you probably have, though mentions of the technology are coming from roughly the same number of sources.The number of AI mentions on corporate earnings calls spiked more than 75% so far this year relative to the same period in 2022, according to a MarketWatch analysis of AlphaSense/Sentieo transcript data for companies worth at least $5 billion. The topic of AI has come up on roughly 280 of those calls in 2023, comparable to what was seen in the same period a year ago. But executives are getting more breathless in their discussions, with 1,770 mentions of AI or artificial intelligence so far this year, up from 1,006 last year. Those counts also include references from analysts who ask questions about AI. Looking at a broader swath of companies that includes smaller ones, February 2023 saw a record number of earnings calls that discussed artificial intelligence, though that growth still didn’t come close to the increase in the number of mentions. There were 488 transcripts mentioning AI in February, besting the 440 from November 2021 by nearly 11%. Previously: Tech execs can’t stop talking about AI after success of ChatGPTThe AI discussion continues to get more global, according to Nick Mazing, the research director at AlphaSense/Sentieo. Additionally, it’s spanning more industries, as marketers, real-estate companies and medical businesses find new applications. Tempting as it may be to inform investors of involvement with a hot trend, companies have been warned to tread carefully with their AI mentions. A Federal Trade Commission lawyer cautioned recently that companies wouldn’t be able to get away with “baseless claims” of “AI-enabled” products. For more: Watch your ‘AI hype,’ feds warn tech companiesThe AI mania arrived in the wake of OpenAI’s public launch of ChatGPT, a generative-AI chatbot that showed more people what could be done with artificial intelligence.

Learn MoreShares of Nvidia (NVDA -1.11%) rose 18.8% last month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, due to a strong quarterly earnings report and positive industry news from its peer group. The growth stock rose and fell throughout February due to broader market forces, but its quarterly results sent shares firmly higher during the last week of the month.Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices released its quarterly results on the last day of January. AMD indicated significant demand among data center customers, which helped to offset weakness in the consumer PC market. The semiconductor stock climbed following this news, dragging Nvidia higher in the first week of February. Wall Street is excited about Nvidia's long-term opportunity in the data center market, so this news was bullish for both companies. Later in the month, some of those gains were erased as the market tumbled due to rising concerns about high interest rates and economic weakness.Image source: Getty Images.Nvidia managed to break the late-month slump with a strong earnings report. The chipmaker's revenue dropped more than 20%, and it only modestly topped analyst estimates.
