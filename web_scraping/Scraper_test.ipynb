Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreShares of server company Super Micro Computer (SMCI 0.21%) rose 35.4% in February, according\\xa0to data provided by\\xa0S&P Global Market Intelligence.Super Micro stock was the rare 2022 winner in the tech space, nearly doubling in a year when the Nasdaq fell over 30%. In January, the stock became the target of a short report from activist short-seller Spruce Point Capital, which caused the stock to sell off as investors booked gains and shorts piled in.However, Super Micro reported solid results on Jan. 31 after market close, and the stock regained its footing through February. Moreover, Super Micro is a close partner of Nvidia,\\xa0which reported better-than-expected results and gave a positive outlook on artificial intelligence (AI) server demand.In its second fiscal quarter ending in December, Super Micro reported 53.8% revenue growth to $1.8 billion, beating expectations by $20 million, with non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $3.26, beating expectations by $0.23. That\\'s certainly eye-popping growth, and defies a lot of other technology hardware companies showing revenue declines. The outperformance can likely be attributed to Super Micro\\'s energy-efficient and customizable server designs, which are finding favor among companies investing in AI and 5G capabilities, especially in an age of electricity price volatility.Of note, Super Micro did guide for a sequential decline in the quarter ahead; however, the March quarter is usually a seasonally lower quarter. Moreover, CEO Charles Liang said he expects mid-30% growth for fiscal 2023 ending in June. Even more encouraging and maybe surprising, Liang also said he expects 20% growth in fiscal 2024. How does Super Micro plan to defy the tough economy? Given that Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia all have brand-new advanced chips that just hit the market, Liang believes that will sustain Super Micro\\'s sales growth, despite the economic slowdown.Super Micro also has a close relationship with Nvidia. On Nvidia\\'s Feb. 22 earnings conference call, CEO Jensen Huang had positive things to say about its data center business, claiming the advent of ChatGPT and generative AI had \"brought AI to an inflection point.\" Nvidia CFO Colette Kress added she expects Nvidia\\'s data center revenue to accelerate throughout the year.That also bodes well for Super Micro, which sells AI servers powered by Nvidia GPUs. On SMCI\\'s conference call, management pointed to AI/GPU platforms showing strong outperformance, exceeding 20% of revenue and calling AI/GPU servers a \"significant opportunity.\"Super Micro Computer is a server assembler, which doesn\\'t seem like that great of a business. However, its close co-development relationships with Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, as well as its focus on energy-efficient server system design is certainly \"serving\" it well these days. Moreover, even after the stock\\'s massive run, it only trades at a 9 P/E multiple. All in all, Super Micro still looks like the value investor\\'s way to play the AI megatrend.

The Semiconductor Industry Association said Friday that global chip-industry sales for January fell 18.5% to $41.3 billion from a year ago and 5.2% from December 2022’s $43.6 billion.“Despite record-high sales in 2022, the global semiconductor market cooled considerably during the second half of the year, and that trend continued during the first month of 2023,” said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO. “Despite the current short-term cyclical downturn, the long-term outlook for the semiconductor market remains strong due to the ever-increasing role of chips in powering the critical technologies of today and tomorrow.”Looking at SIA data, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon noted that month-over-month data was worse than typical seasonality and that memory-chip sales — those from companies like Micron Technology Inc. \\n        MU,\\n        -2.23%\\n       — fell 58.6% year-over-year.For Nvidia, “opportunities around data center, software and auto remain early, and large,” Rasgon said, even with gaming headwinds and near-term China sentiment; Broadcom “has a good narrative & margin of safety with semi revenue visibility, software offering support, cash deployment, superb margins & [free cash flow], & attractive valuation;” and Qualcomm struggles against “a weak market and channel flush … impacting near-term trajectory, but the shares remain very inexpensive and setup into 2024 looks good as things normalize and Apple Inc. \\n        AAPL,\\n        -1.45%\\n       business hangs around.”For AMD, “the server story is working, though PC weakness (and potentially damaging behavior from their competitor) is weighing, and margins may face headwinds,” and Intel’s “long-term structural issues have finally broken to the forefront,” Rasgon wrote.Rasgon has outperform ratings on Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Broadcom, market-perform rating on AMD, and an underperform rating on Intel.

A MarketWatch analysis shows you probably have, though mentions of the technology are coming from roughly the same number of sources.The number of AI mentions on corporate earnings calls spiked more than 75% so far this year relative to the same period in 2022, according to a MarketWatch analysis of AlphaSense/Sentieo transcript data for companies worth at least $5 billion. The topic of AI has come up on roughly 280 of those calls in 2023, comparable to what was seen in the same period a year ago. But executives are getting more breathless in their discussions, with 1,770 mentions of AI or artificial intelligence so far this year, up from 1,006 last year. Those counts also include references from analysts who ask questions about AI. Looking at a broader swath of companies that includes smaller ones, February 2023 saw a record number of earnings calls that discussed artificial intelligence, though that growth still didn’t come close to the increase in the number of mentions. There were 488 transcripts mentioning AI in February, besting the 440 from November 2021 by nearly 11%. Previously: Tech execs can’t stop talking about AI after success of ChatGPTThe AI discussion continues to get more global, according to Nick Mazing, the research director at AlphaSense/Sentieo. Additionally, it’s spanning more industries, as marketers, real-estate companies and medical businesses find new applications. Tempting as it may be to inform investors of involvement with a hot trend, companies have been warned to tread carefully with their AI mentions. A Federal Trade Commission lawyer cautioned recently that companies wouldn’t be able to get away with “baseless claims” of “AI-enabled” products.

Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress also called out an “inflection point” for AI. “Generative-AI applications will help almost every industry do more faster,” she said.Read: Nvidia adds to AI hype with new cloud-based service, stock jumps on forecastThere was also a big pickup in AI discussion on Broadcom’s latest earnings call, with participants bringing up the topic 47 times, compared with just seven times in all of the earnings calls the company held in 2022, according to AlphaSense/Sentieo data.“We’re doing $200 million as far as we could estimate of silicon, Ethernet switches and fabric that goes into those AI networks as far as we could identify in hyperscalers,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said on the company’s early March call.

Learn MoreShares of Nvidia (NVDA -1.11%) rose 18.8% last month, according\\xa0to\\xa0data\\xa0provided\\xa0by\\xa0S&P Global Market Intelligence, due to a strong quarterly earnings report and positive industry news from its peer group. The growth stock rose and fell throughout February due to broader market forces, but its quarterly results sent shares firmly higher during the last week of the month.Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices\\xa0released its quarterly results on the last day of January. AMD indicated significant demand among data center customers, which helped to offset weakness in the consumer PC market. The semiconductor stock climbed following this news, dragging Nvidia higher in the first week of February. Wall Street is excited about Nvidia's long-term opportunity in the data center market, so this news was bullish for both companies. Later in the month, some of those gains were erased as the market tumbled due to rising concerns about high interest rates and economic weakness.Image source: Getty Images.Nvidia managed to break the late-month slump with a strong earnings report. The chipmaker's revenue dropped more than 20%, and it only modestly topped analyst estimates. However, investors were focused on stellar performance from data center and automotive applications, which are considered two long-term growth avenues for Nvidia.The company's artificial intelligence segment also generated some buzz, tying into a tech sector trend that has garnered a ton of attention in recent months. Surging interest in ChatGPT and other AI projects has led to significant movement in many high-profile tech stocks. Investors are eager to identify the early winners and losers as these emerging technologies start to bear fruit, and Nvidia was one of the trend's major beneficiaries.Investors are struggling to set stock prices amid uncertainty around interest rates and global economic growth. It's hard to tell if tougher times lie ahead, or if most of the damage has already been inflicted. That's creating volatility in the market, especially among growth stocks. It's also driving many investors into high-quality stocks that have strong long-term catalysts. Nvidia certainly fits that description, as one of the dominant players in the semiconductor world and an early leader in growth categories including artificial intelligence, automotive, and blockchain.Despite experiencing major weakness in the gaming and PC markets, the stock's forward P/E ratio is still above 50. Investors certainly have to pay a premium for quality. Nonetheless, these technology megatrends seem inevitable, and component suppliers will be among the beneficiaries. Nvidia looks to be one of the most likely candidates to generate major cash flow growth as a result.Ryan Downie has positions in Nvidia.
