      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>AMD's stock plummeted 55% in 2022 amid economic challenges. However, the company's shares have steadily risen 26% since Jan. 1, as tech stocks have come back into favor with investors and the release of promising quarter results.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>With its stock showing signs of recovery, now is an excellent time to learn more about this company of the future. Here are three things about AMD that smart investors know.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>AMD's biggest competitor and the company it is most often compared to is <strong>Nvidia</strong>. Both companies compete in the consumer graphics processing unit (GPU) market, with their stocks similarly plunging over 50% in 2022 amid declines in PC component spending. </p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>However, there are a few reasons AMD is the better investment. Last year was difficult for all companies in the PC market, with worldwide shipments of GPUs falling 42% throughout 2022. AMD fared better, though, with its 8% market share in consumer GPUs, compared to Nvidia's 88%. As a result, in fiscal 2022, AMD's revenue rose 43.6% year over year to $23.6 billion, while Nvidia's increased 0.2% to $26.97 billion. </p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>AMD's better distribution of revenue meant that while its PC-centered segments suffered last year, it could pivot its business to more lucrative segments like data centers and embedded products. Combined, these segments reported revenue growth of 169% year over year to $10.5 billion in 2022. AMD has similar prospects to Nvidia in high-growth markets like <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and data centers but feels like a stronger and more reliable business thanks to its diversity. </p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>According to Grand View Research, the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/virtual-reality-stocks/\">virtual reality</a> (VR) market was worth $21.83 billion in 2021 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% through 2030. Meanwhile, AMD holds a dominating position in the industry as the producer of the hardware necessary to run and develop VR software. In fact, AMD has already partnered with <strong>Microsoft's</strong> Windows Mixed Reality, <strong>HTC's</strong> Vive, and <strong>Meta Platform</strong>'s Oculus to power their respective VR headsets.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/\">tech giant</a> <strong>Apple</strong> is expected to launch its first-ever mixed-reality headset in 2023, potentially boosting the market substantially. The iPhone company has a history of entering new markets with its products and rapidly speeding up the mass adoption of technology. Apple achieved this when launching its take on smartphones, tablets, Bluetooth headphones, and smartwatches.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>As a result, AMD could significantly benefit from Apple's venture into VR, as it would encourage more competition and drum up more business for the chipmaker.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>AI has been a hot topic in tech in recent months after start-up OpenAI launched its advanced chatbot, ChatGPT, in November 2022. The program's ability to produce human-like dialogue wowed the tech world and shined a light on an industry valued by Grand View Research at $136.55 billion in 2022 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 37.3% through 2030. </p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p class=\"p1\">Similar to VR, AMD is an excellent way to invest in the hardware side of <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/\">the AI market</a>. The company's GPUs and processors have the power to run and develop AI software, making its offerings incredibly attractive to companies like Microsoft, <strong>Amazon</strong>, and <strong>Alphabet</strong>, which are currently in a race to be crowned the king of artificial intelligence.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p class=\"p1\">AI has the potential to enhance countless industries, from machine learning to healthcare, self-driving cars, education, and more. AMD CEO Lisa Su revealed in the company's fourth quarter of 2022 earnings call, \"You can expect additional AI acceleration coming in our server portfolio ... So you're going to see AI broadly across our road maps.\"</p>>\n",

      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Even in the wake of a tremendous surge in recent months, Nvidia's shares remain well below their 52-week high.

      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>More importantly, the use of the company's chips in data centers is now Nvidia's biggest moneymaker. The increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) will almost certainly fuel massive growth in this area.</p>>\n",

      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>In the views of some investors, Meta's best days are behind it. The company's main social media platform isn't growing as it did in the past.

In addition, Meta's roll of the dice on the metaverse just might pay off in a huge way if CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision is fulfilled.

In fact, \"AI\" was mentioned a whopping 75 times on Nvidia's late-February <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/22/nvidia-nvda-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript/\">earnings conference call</a>.

      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>But at the same time, investors need to be aware of another market where Nvidia is in the driver's seat since it could substantially boost the company's growth in the long run.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud gaming service might not have received a lot of attention on the earnings call, but it would be a good idea to dig a bit deeper into how the company fares in this space. That's because the cloud gaming market is expected to clock a terrific annual growth rate of 41.7% over the next decade, generating more than $42 billion in annual revenue in 2032.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>The cloud gaming market's growth is just getting started. Video-game data and analytics provider Newzoo estimates that this industry generated $2.4 billion in revenue last year -- a massive jump of 73% over the cloud gaming industry's 2021 revenue of $1.37 billion.

      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>According to Newzoo, the global video gaming industry's revenue was down 4.3% in 2022 to $184.4 billion. Surging inflation, the fear of a potential recession, and the fact that gamers <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/30/top-growth-stock-doubled-2020-fly-higher-nvidia/\">spent a lot of money</a> on hardware and software during the pandemic weighed on the market last year.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>But cloud gaming still grew rapidly, which is not surprising because it gives gamers a cheap way to enjoy their favorite games without having to invest in expensive hardware or having to buy gaming titles.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Gamers simply need to buy a subscription to a cloud gaming service such as GeForce Now, which will allow them to stream games to their phones, laptops, desktops, internet browsers, and even televisions. The games run on remote servers in data centers, and they are delivered to the user using a fast internet connection.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Nvidia's paid membership plans ($9.99 or $19.99 a month) allow members to stream games in high resolution and at high frame rates, irrespective of the hardware.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>For instance, a Windows personal computer (PC) with the old 64-bit Windows 7 operating system, is capable of streaming games through GeForce Now with the help of a fast internet connection. On the other hand, building an entry-level gaming PC could cost at least $300, and that might not be enough to play the latest graphics-intensive games.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>This explains why the cloud gaming market's growth could be here to stay for a long time to come, and that's going to be a tailwind for Nvidia stock. Let's see why.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Nvidia generated $11.9 billion in revenue from its graphics business last year. Of this, $9 billion came from sales of gaming graphics cards and $1.5 billion from sales of professional visualization cards used in workstation PCs. So the company generated $10.5 billion from sales of physical graphics cards, indicating that the GeForce Now cloud gaming business generated $1.4 billion in revenue last fiscal year.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Based on Newzoo's estimate that the overall cloud gaming market generated $2.4 billion in revenue last year, as discussed earlier, Nvidia's revenue share of this fast-growing space stood at 58% last year. What's more, it had 25 million GeForce Now subscribers at the end of fiscal 2023, up from <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/02/08/nvidia-position-nascent-market-strong-growth/\">15 million a year ago</a>.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>The terrific growth in Nvidia's cloud gaming subscriber base also means that it is the service of choice for gamers. According to Newzoo, there were 31.7 million paying users of cloud gaming services last year, which means that Nvidia's share of subscribers in this huge market stood at an impressive 79%.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Looking ahead, the number of people streaming games from the cloud is expected to more than double by 2025, and the market is expected to sustain its momentum in the long run, as we have already seen in this article.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>So if Nvidia continues to be a dominant player in cloud gaming in the long run, it could generate a lot of revenue from this space. For instance, a 50% share of cloud gaming's potential revenue after a decade could add $21 billion to Nvidia's top line based on the $42 billion revenue the market is expected to generate in 2032.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>That would be way bigger than the company's annual gaming revenue of $9 billion last fiscal year. Of course, if Nvidia manages to enhance its dominance in cloud gaming, it could generate more revenue from this space.

      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Super Micro stock was the rare 2022 winner in the tech space, nearly doubling in a year when the <strong>Nasdaq</strong> fell over 30%.

      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>However, Super Micro reported solid results on Jan. 31 after market close, and the stock regained its footing through February. Moreover, Super Micro is a close partner of <strong>Nvidia</strong>, which reported better-than-expected results and gave a positive outlook on artificial intelligence (AI) server demand.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>In its second fiscal quarter ending in December, Super Micro reported 53.8% revenue growth to $1.8 billion, beating expectations by $20 million, with <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/gaap-vs-non-gaap/\">non-GAAP</a> (adjusted) earnings per share of $3.26, beating expectations by $0.23. </p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>That's certainly eye-popping growth, and defies a lot of other technology hardware companies showing revenue declines.

      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Of note, Super Micro did guide for a sequential decline in the quarter ahead; however, the March quarter is usually a seasonally lower quarter.

      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>How does Super Micro plan to defy the tough economy?

      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Super Micro also has a close relationship with Nvidia. On Nvidia's Feb. 22 earnings conference call, CEO Jensen Huang had positive things to say about its data center business, claiming the advent of ChatGPT and generative AI had \"brought AI to an inflection point.\" Nvidia CFO Colette Kress added she expects Nvidia's data center revenue to accelerate throughout the year.</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>That also bodes well for Super Micro, which sells AI servers powered by Nvidia GPUs. On SMCI's conference call, management pointed to AI/GPU platforms showing strong outperformance, exceeding 20% of revenue and calling AI/GPU servers a \"significant opportunity.\"</p>>\n",
      "<bound method PageElement.get_text of <p>Super Micro Computer is a server assembler, which doesn't seem like that great of a business.
