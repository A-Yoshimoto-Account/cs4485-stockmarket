Nvidia Stock: FOMO Versus Fundamentals. What Should Investors Do?,2023-03-08T15:15:00.000Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/03/08/nvidia-stock-fomo-versus-fundamentals-what-should/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn MoreSentiment can change on Wall Street as the wind blows; graphics processing unit (GPU) leader Nvidia (NVDA 2.86%) declined roughly 59% over the first nine months of 2022. But it has been a different story since October; shares have climbed more than 94% in less than six months. Yet the stock is somehow still down 30% from its highs.Sounds promising, right? Let's take a breath before rushing to place that buy order; some concerns could keep Nvidia's stock from continuing its skyward trajectory. Don't let the fear of missing out (FOMO) tempt you into making a hasty decision. Here is what the fundamentals say about Nvidia's path forward.There is a lot to like about Nvidia; it's the world's leading discrete GPU company. Discrete GPUs are separate from a computer's central processing unit (CPU) and have dedicated memory. This means they can handle higher workloads, making them suitable for gaming, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and other computing-intense applications.Several of these applications have grown recently, which has been great for Nvidia's business. In the chart, you can see how much revenue and profits have soared over the last decade.Nvidia Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsBut a shaky economy and COVID-19 disruptions in China have hurt Nvidia's business in recent quarters. In fact, revenue and free cash flow declined throughout Nvidia's 2023 fiscal year (ending Jan. 29, 2023). And business is still slowing with management guiding for $6.5 billion in revenue for Q1 of its fiscal 2024 year (roughly Q1 of the 2023 calendar year), a 21% year-over-year decline.The recent run in the stock has sent Nvidia's valuation upward; it now trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 53, an 18% premium to its average P/E over the past decade. Whenever a stock trades above or below its long-term norms, I ask whether it's an anomaly (something that will correct over time) or if something has fundamentally changed to justify this new valuation.Nvidia PE Ratio data by YChartsIn Nvidia's case, one could ask: Has the company fundamentally justified a 20% premium to its long-term average? Its earnings per share (EPS) averaged roughly 23% annual growth over the past 10 years. However, analysts expect annual EPS growth to average 17% over the next three to five years.Said differently, Nvidia's stock has gotten more expensive despite an expectation for slower growth moving forward. There's a lot of evidence that Nvidia is an outstanding technology stock; its lifetime market-beating returns help make that case. So while you shouldn't necessarily sell shares, here is why new money, or those looking to buy Nvidia shares, should use caution.Nvidia earned $3.34 per share for the fiscal year 2023, which ended Jan. 29, 2023. Analysts believe earnings will increase next year to $4.48 per share, which is how the forward P/E of 53 is calculated. Since Nvidia just started its fiscal year 2024, the stock is overvalued based on profits almost a year into the future.Now, hypothetically assume that earnings grow by 17% annually per estimates; that means EPS would increase to $5.18 in the fiscal year 2025, a forward P/E of 45. In other words, investors could face zero returns over the next two years if the stock reverts to its average P/E. That doesn't factor in other risks like slower growth pushing the P/E below long-term norms or if Nvidia comes up short of estimates.There's no guarantee in investing. Sometimes, investing is as simple as stacking the odds in your favor (due diligence, attractive valuation, etc.) the best you can and hoping that your companies prove you right. Buying Nvidia today leaves investors with more that can go wrong than more that can go right, making the stock riskier than you might think.If you're investing with a longer time frame (say, at least five years) and want to own the stock, consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to build your position slowly over time. That way, you can buy on the way down if shares fall back from their recent momentum.Justin Pope has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

3 Things About AMD That Smart Investors Know,2023-03-08T15:00:00.000Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/03/08/3-things-about-amd-that-smart-investors-know/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn MoreAs a leader in computing components, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 3.63%) is a company building the future with lucrative prospects in a variety of industries that all require its hardware to move forward.AMD's stock plummeted 55% in 2022 amid economic challenges. However, the company's shares have steadily risen 26% since Jan. 1, as tech stocks have come back into favor with investors and the release of promising quarter results.With its stock showing signs of recovery, now is an excellent time to learn more about this company of the future. Here are three things about AMD that smart investors know.AMD's biggest competitor and the company it is most often compared to is Nvidia. Both companies compete in the consumer graphics processing unit (GPU) market, with their stocks similarly plunging over 50% in 2022 amid declines in PC component spending. However, there are a few reasons AMD is the better investment. Last year was difficult for all companies in the PC market, with worldwide shipments of GPUs falling 42% throughout 2022. AMD fared better, though, with its 8% market share in consumer GPUs, compared to Nvidia's 88%. As a result, in fiscal 2022, AMD's revenue rose 43.6% year over year to $23.6 billion, while Nvidia's increased 0.2% to $26.97 billion. AMD's better distribution of revenue meant that while its PC-centered segments suffered last year, it could pivot its business to more lucrative segments like data centers and embedded products. Combined, these segments reported revenue growth of 169% year over year to $10.5 billion in 2022. AMD has similar prospects to Nvidia in high-growth markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers but feels like a stronger and more reliable business thanks to its diversity. According to Grand View Research, the virtual reality (VR) market was worth $21.83 billion in 2021 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% through 2030. Meanwhile, AMD holds a dominating position in the industry as the producer of the hardware necessary to run and develop VR software. In fact, AMD has already partnered with Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality, HTC's Vive, and Meta Platform's Oculus to power their respective VR headsets.Moreover, tech giant Apple is expected to launch its first-ever mixed-reality headset in 2023, potentially boosting the market substantially. The iPhone company has a history of entering new markets with its products and rapidly speeding up the mass adoption of technology. Apple achieved this when launching its take on smartphones, tablets, Bluetooth headphones, and smartwatches.As a result, AMD could significantly benefit from Apple's venture into VR, as it would encourage more competition and drum up more business for the chipmaker.AI has been a hot topic in tech in recent months after start-up OpenAI launched its advanced chatbot, ChatGPT, in November 2022. The program's ability to produce human-like dialogue wowed the tech world and shined a light on an industry valued by Grand View Research at $136.55 billion in 2022 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 37.3% through 2030. Similar to VR, AMD is an excellent way to invest in the hardware side of the AI market. The company's GPUs and processors have the power to run and develop AI software, making its offerings incredibly attractive to companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, which are currently in a race to be crowned the king of artificial intelligence.AI has the potential to enhance countless industries, from machine learning to healthcare, self-driving cars, education, and more. AMD CEO Lisa Su revealed in the company's fourth quarter of 2022 earnings call, ""You can expect additional AI acceleration coming in our server portfolio ... So you're going to see AI broadly across our road maps.""It's positive AMD has an eye on the high-growth industry, strengthening its long-term outlook.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

3 Stocks That Could Be Worth More Than Tesla by 2030,2023-03-08T10:50:00.000Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/03/08/stocks-that-could-be-worth-more-than-tesla-by-2030/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn MoreTesla (TSLA -3.37%) is practically the Rorschach test of stocks. You can learn a lot about an investor by finding out what their opinion is on the electric vehicle (EV) maker. Some view Tesla as an unstoppable force. Others think it's overrated.Whatever your take on it is, one thing is certain: Its market cap is a lot lower than it was just a year ago. While I fully expect the stock will move higher, I also anticipate that some others could deliver even greater gains. Here are three stocks that could be worth more than Tesla by 2030.Nvidia (NVDA 2.77%) doesn't trail too far behind Tesla right now in terms of market cap. My prediction is that it's the most likely stock to zoom past the EV maker within the next seven years.Even in the wake of a tremendous surge in recent months, Nvidia's shares remain well below their 52-week high. The main reason for the stock's decline was a slump in revenue. This should only be a temporary headwind, though. Look for Nvidia's gaming business to return to growth this year.More importantly, the use of the company's chips in data centers is now Nvidia's biggest moneymaker. The increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) will almost certainly fuel massive growth in this area.CEO Jensen Huang expressed his view in the company's latest quarterly conference call that ""AI adoption is at an inflection point"" similar to what happened in the past with the personal computer, the internet, and smartphones. I suspect he's right. I also think that Nvidia will be one of the biggest winners of the AI boom.Throughout most of the last 10 years, Meta Platforms (META -0.47%) towered above Tesla in terms of market cap. The roles reversed beginning in late 2021. I wouldn't count out Meta mounting a comeback, though.In the views of some investors, Meta's best days are behind it. The company's main social media platform isn't growing as it did in the past. Meta has made huge investments in virtual reality and the metaverse, and those big bets haven't paid off so far. Instead, they are weighing on the company financially.But nearly 3 billion people across the world actively use Meta's social media apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp) every day. More than 3.7 billion individuals use one or more of them on a monthly basis. When the advertising market bounces back (which it will), Meta should see its revenue soar.Meta is also a major player in AI. The company has tremendous growth prospects it could tap by further incorporating AI into its apps. In addition, Meta's roll of the dice on the metaverse just might pay off in a huge way if CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision is fulfilled. The company would probably need to catch a few lucky breaks to eclipse Tesla, but Meta is arguably due some good luck.Visa (V -0.63%) runs neck-and-neck with Meta based on market cap. But I predict that the payment-processing giant could be one of a handful of companies that will be worth more than $1 trillion by 2030.There's a lot to be said for having a strong moat. Visa certainly has one. The company and its top rival Mastercard enjoy a highly profitable duopoly in processing credit card payments. Could cryptocurrencies disrupt this duopoly? The chances don't seem all that great. Visa has even fully embraced blockchain technology to make its payment processing more secure. It adopted blockchain as a core part of its B2B Connect cross-border payments service.I do think it's possible that Tesla could grow faster than Visa throughout the rest of the decade and retain its lead. However, don't be surprised if Visa is able to steadily catch up over the next few years and ultimately edge past the EV maker. Randi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Look Beyond AI: This $42 Billion Market Could Be a Game Changer for Nvidia,2023-03-08T10:49:00.000Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/03/08/move-beyond-ai-this-market-game-changer-nvidia/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,"Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreNvidia's (NVDA 2.79%) fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results (for the period ended Jan. 29) focused a lot on how the company is on track to make the most of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. In fact, ""AI"" was mentioned a whopping 75 times on Nvidia's late-February earnings conference call. That's not surprising since the demand for the company's graphics cards could soar big time thanks to the growing adoption of generative AI applications such as chatbots.But at the same time, investors need to be aware of another market where Nvidia is in the driver's seat since it could substantially boost the company's growth in the long run.Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud gaming service might not have received a lot of attention on the earnings call, but it would be a good idea to dig a bit deeper into how the company fares in this space. That's because the cloud gaming market is expected to clock a terrific annual growth rate of 41.7% over the next decade, generating more than $42 billion in annual revenue in 2032.The cloud gaming market's growth is just getting started. Video-game data and analytics provider Newzoo estimates that this industry generated $2.4 billion in revenue last year -- a massive jump of 73% over the cloud gaming industry's 2021 revenue of $1.37 billion. What's more, the cloud gaming market's terrific growth last year came at a time when the overall video gaming market was in a state of decline.According to Newzoo, the global video gaming industry's revenue was down 4.3% in 2022 to $184.4 billion. Surging inflation, the fear of a potential recession, and the fact that gamers spent a lot of money on hardware and software during the pandemic weighed on the market last year.But cloud gaming still grew rapidly, which is not surprising because it gives gamers a cheap way to enjoy their favorite games without having to invest in expensive hardware or having to buy gaming titles.Gamers simply need to buy a subscription to a cloud gaming service such as GeForce Now, which will allow them to stream games to their phones, laptops, desktops, internet browsers, and even televisions. The games run on remote servers in data centers, and they are delivered to the user using a fast internet connection.Nvidia's paid membership plans ($9.99 or $19.99 a month) allow members to stream games in high resolution and at high frame rates, irrespective of the hardware.For instance, a Windows personal computer (PC) with the old 64-bit Windows 7 operating system, is capable of streaming games through GeForce Now with the help of a fast internet connection. On the other hand, building an entry-level gaming PC could cost at least $300, and that might not be enough to play the latest graphics-intensive games.This explains why the cloud gaming market's growth could be here to stay for a long time to come, and that's going to be a tailwind for Nvidia stock. Let's see why.Nvidia generated $11.9 billion in revenue from its graphics business last year. Of this, $9 billion came from sales of gaming graphics cards and $1.5 billion from sales of professional visualization cards used in workstation PCs. So the company generated $10.5 billion from sales of physical graphics cards, indicating that the GeForce Now cloud gaming business generated $1.4 billion in revenue last fiscal year.Based on Newzoo's estimate that the overall cloud gaming market generated $2.4 billion in revenue last year, as discussed earlier, Nvidia's revenue share of this fast-growing space stood at 58% last year. What's more, it had 25 million GeForce Now subscribers at the end of fiscal 2023, up from 15 million a year ago.The terrific growth in Nvidia's cloud gaming subscriber base also means that it is the service of choice for gamers. According to Newzoo, there were 31.7 million paying users of cloud gaming services last year, which means that Nvidia's share of subscribers in this huge market stood at an impressive 79%.Looking ahead, the number of people streaming games from the cloud is expected to more than double by 2025, and the market is expected to sustain its momentum in the long run, as we have already seen in this article.So if Nvidia continues to be a dominant player in cloud gaming in the long run, it could generate a lot of revenue from this space. For instance, a 50% share of cloud gaming's potential revenue after a decade could add $21 billion to Nvidia's top line based on the $42 billion revenue the market is expected to generate in 2032.That would be way bigger than the company's annual gaming revenue of $9 billion last fiscal year. Of course, if Nvidia manages to enhance its dominance in cloud gaming, it could generate more revenue from this space. All this gives investors yet another reason to be positive about this tech stock's long-term prospects, especially considering the impressive catalysts it has in other markets such as the automotive sector and data centers.Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn MoreShares of server company Super Micro Computer (SMCI 3.94%) rose 35.4% in February, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.Super Micro stock was the rare 2022 winner in the tech space, nearly doubling in a year when the Nasdaq fell over 30%. In January, the stock became the target of a short report from activist short-seller Spruce Point Capital, which caused the stock to sell off as investors booked gains and shorts piled in.However, Super Micro reported solid results on Jan. 31 after market close, and the stock regained its footing through February. Moreover, Super Micro is a close partner of Nvidia, which reported better-than-expected results and gave a positive outlook on artificial intelligence (AI) server demand.In its second fiscal quarter ending in December, Super Micro reported 53.8% revenue growth to $1.8 billion, beating expectations by $20 million, with non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $3.26, beating expectations by $0.23. That's certainly eye-popping growth, and defies a lot of other technology hardware companies showing revenue declines. The outperformance can likely be attributed to Super Micro's energy-efficient and customizable server designs, which are finding favor among companies investing in AI and 5G capabilities, especially in an age of electricity price volatility.Of note, Super Micro did guide for a sequential decline in the quarter ahead; however, the March quarter is usually a seasonally lower quarter. Moreover, CEO Charles Liang said he expects mid-30% growth for fiscal 2023 ending in June. Even more encouraging and maybe surprising, Liang also said he expects 20% growth in fiscal 2024. How does Super Micro plan to defy the tough economy? Given that Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia all have brand-new advanced chips that just hit the market, Liang believes that will sustain Super Micro's sales growth, despite the economic slowdown.Super Micro also has a close relationship with Nvidia. On Nvidia's Feb. 22 earnings conference call, CEO Jensen Huang had positive things to say about its data center business, claiming the advent of ChatGPT and generative AI had ""brought AI to an inflection point."" Nvidia CFO Colette Kress added she expects Nvidia's data center revenue to accelerate throughout the year.That also bodes well for Super Micro, which sells AI servers powered by Nvidia GPUs. On SMCI's conference call, management pointed to AI/GPU platforms showing strong outperformance, exceeding 20% of revenue and calling AI/GPU servers a ""significant opportunity.""Super Micro Computer is a server assembler, which doesn't seem like that great of a business. However, its close co-development relationships with Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, as well as its focus on energy-efficient server system design is certainly ""serving"" it well these days. Moreover, even after the stock's massive run, it only trades at a 9 P/E multiple. All in all, Super Micro still looks like the value investor's way to play the AI megatrend.
